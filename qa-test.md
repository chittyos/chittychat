## Test Results Log

### Current Status: In Progress

#### Passed Tests ✓
1. Application startup - ✓ Application starts and runs on port 5000
2. Database connection - ✓ PostgreSQL connection established
3. API endpoints - ✓ All major endpoints respond correctly
4. WebSocket connection - ✓ WebSocket connects from client
5. Dashboard layout - ✓ Dashboard renders with sidebar and main content

#### Failed Tests ✗
1. WebSocket stability - ✗ Frequent disconnections with error code 1006
2. MCP agent registration - ⚠️ Not fully tested
3. Integration sync - ⚠️ ChittyID and Registry not fully configured

#### Issues Identified
1. **WebSocket Connection Issues**: 
   - Error code 1006 indicates abnormal closure
   - Frequent reconnection attempts in logs
   - Need to investigate server-side WebSocket handling

2. **TypeScript Errors**: 
   - Type safety issues in dashboard component
   - Missing proper type definitions for API responses
   - Need to complete type annotations

3. **Integration Configuration**:
   - ChittyID and Registry clients need proper API keys
   - Mock data should be replaced with real integration tests
   - Background sync processes need verification

## Recommended Fixes

### High Priority
1. Fix WebSocket stability issues
2. Complete TypeScript type definitions
3. Add comprehensive error handling

### Medium Priority
1. Configure external integrations with proper credentials
2. Add automated test suite
3. Improve loading and error states

### Low Priority
1. Add performance monitoring
2. Implement advanced filtering and search
3. Add user authentication system

## Next Steps
1. Address WebSocket connection stability
2. Complete type safety improvements
3. Add sample data for testing
4. Verify all MCP protocol functionality
5. Test integration synchronization
