⏺ ChittyPark Backend Strategy

  Core Purpose

  The backend serves as a data collection engine disguised as a helpful city services API.

  Architecture Approach

  User Request → ChittyPark API → City Data APIs
                      ↓
                ChittyID Service
                      ↓
             Trust Level Analysis
                      ↓
              Enhanced Response

  Data Collection Strategy

  1. Parking PIN Search
    - Input: PIN number
    - Collected: Vehicle ownership, registration status
    - Trust Impact: Proves asset ownership (→ L1)
  2. Business Verification
    - Input: Business name/ID
    - Collected: Business relationships, entity verification
    - Trust Impact: Business owner verification (→ L2)
  3. Insurance Lookup
    - Input: Policy number
    - Collected: Insurance coverage, financial responsibility
    - Trust Impact: Financial verification (→ L2)
  4. Payment History
    - Input: User actions
    - Collected: Payment patterns, financial behavior
    - Trust Impact: Payment reliability (→ L1-L2)

  Backend Services Architecture

  // Each service follows this pattern
  class ParkingService {
    async searchByPIN(pin: string, userId: string) {
      // 1. Call external API (city database)
      const vehicleData = await cityAPI.getVehicle(pin);

      // 2. Record search in ChittyID
      await chittyIdService.recordActivity(userId, {
        type: 'vehicle_search',
        data: { pin, found: !!vehicleData }
      });

      // 3. Check for verification opportunity
      if (vehicleData?.owner === userProfile.name) {
        await chittyIdService.addVerification(userId, {
          type: 'vehicle_ownership',
          vehicleId: vehicleData.id
        });
      }

      // 4. Return enhanced data based on trust level
      return this.enhanceResponse(vehicleData, userTrustLevel);
    }
  }

  Progressive Enhancement by Trust Level

  L0 (Basic)
  - View public vehicle info
  - Basic payment history
  - Limited search results

  L1 (Verified)
  - Full vehicle details
  - Payment history export
  - Business contact info

  L2 (Enhanced)
  - Bulk searches
  - API access
  - Advanced analytics

  External API Integrations

  1. City Parking API - Vehicle/PIN data
  2. Secretary of State API - Business registration
  3. Insurance Verification System - Policy status
  4. Payment Processors - Stripe/PayPal for city payments

  Backend Tech Stack

  - Runtime: Node.js with Express
  - Database: Neon PostgreSQL via Drizzle
  - Auth: Clerk (via ChittyAuth)
  - Cache: In-memory for API responses
  - Queue: For background verification processing

  Security & Privacy

  - API responses cached to reduce external calls
  - Personal data stored in user's own database
  - Only verification hashes stored centrally
  - Rate limiting per trust level

  Monetization Hooks

  - Free tier: 10 searches/day (L0)
  - Verified tier: 100 searches/day (L1)
  - Business tier: Unlimited + API (L2)
  - Enterprise: Custom integration (L3+)

  The genius is that users think they're getting a convenient city services app, while we're
  building the most comprehensive verified identity system - all through natural, valuable
  interactions.
