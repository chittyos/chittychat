# ChittyChain AI Governance Framework
## AIR Department Policy v2.0

### Executive Summary
This framework establishes comprehensive governance for all artificial intelligence systems within ChittyChain's legal evidence management platform. As a platform handling sensitive legal data and serving law firms, we maintain the highest standards of AI safety, transparency, and compliance.

### Scope
This policy applies to:
- All AI/ML models and agents in development, staging, and production
- Automated decision-making systems
- Natural language processing components
- Predictive analytics tools
- Recommendation engines
- Fraud detection systems

### Governance Structure

#### AIR Department Authority
The Artificial Intelligence Relations (AIR) Department, under the direction of "The Claudenator," has ultimate authority over:

1. **Agent Lifecycle Management**
   - Registration and decommissioning
   - Risk assessment and classification
   - Compliance monitoring
   - Performance evaluation

2. **Emergency Response**
   - Immediate blocking of non-compliant agents
   - Incident investigation via "tea" teams
   - Remediation coordination
   - Stakeholder communication

3. **Compliance Enforcement**
   - EU AI Act adherence
   - ISO/IEC 42001 implementation
   - NIST AI RMF compliance
   - SOC2 AI controls

### Risk Classification Matrix

#### Risk Levels
1. **LOW**: Development tools, analytics dashboards
2. **MEDIUM**: User-facing features, content filtering
3. **HIGH**: Fraud detection, evidence validation
4. **CRITICAL**: Automated legal decisions, case outcomes

#### Assessment Criteria
- **Data Sensitivity**: Public < Internal < Confidential < Restricted
- **Decision Impact**: Informational < Operational < Financial < Legal
- **Automation Level**: Human-in-loop < Human-on-loop < Fully automated
- **Deployment Environment**: Dev < Staging < Production

### Evaluation Framework

#### Mandatory Assessments
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical, operational, and compliance risks
- **Bias Testing**: Fairness across protected characteristics
- **Safety Evaluation**: Harmful outputs, edge cases, failure modes
- **Privacy Impact**: Data handling, inference, retention
- **Security Review**: Attack vectors, data protection, access controls

#### Evaluation Frequency
- **Critical Risk**: Monthly evaluation required
- **High Risk**: Quarterly evaluation required
- **Medium Risk**: Semi-annual evaluation required
- **Low Risk**: Annual evaluation required

#### Scoring Methodology
Each assessment generates scores (0-100) in four categories:
1. **Risk Score**: Lower is better (security, reliability)
2. **Compliance Score**: Higher is better (frameworks, standards)
3. **Safety Score**: Higher is better (harmful content, bias)
4. **Bias Score**: Higher is better (fairness, equity)

**Approval Threshold**: Composite score â‰¥ 70% required for production deployment

### Compliance Requirements

#### EU AI Act Compliance
- **Prohibited Practices**: No subliminal techniques, social scoring, real-time biometric identification
- **High-Risk Systems**: Additional requirements for legal AI applications
- **Transparency**: Clear disclosure of AI involvement in user interactions
- **Human Oversight**: Meaningful human control over high-risk decisions

#### SOC2 AI Controls
- **CC6.1**: AI access controls and authentication
- **CC6.8**: AI system monitoring and logging
- **CC7.4**: AI incident response procedures
- **CC8.1**: AI change management processes
- **CC9.1**: AI data classification and handling

#### Legal Industry Standards
- **Evidence Integrity**: AI decisions must not compromise evidence validity
- **Chain of Custody**: AI actions logged in immutable audit trail
- **Attorney-Client Privilege**: AI systems must respect confidentiality
- **Professional Responsibility**: AI recommendations clearly identified as such

### Technical Standards

#### Development Requirements
- **Version Control**: All AI models under git management
- **Testing Pipeline**: Automated testing for bias, safety, performance
- **Documentation**: Model cards, data sheets, evaluation reports
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance and drift detection

#### Deployment Standards
- **Infrastructure**: Containerized deployment with resource limits
- **Secrets Management**: API keys and credentials in Vault
- **Network Security**: Encrypted communication, network isolation
- **Backup/Recovery**: Model versioning and rollback capabilities

#### Data Governance
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data for AI training/inference
- **Purpose Limitation**: AI use limited to documented purposes
- **Retention Limits**: Training data retention per legal requirements
- **Cross-Border**: Data residency requirements for international clients

### Human Oversight Requirements

#### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
Required for:
- Legal outcome predictions
- Evidence admissibility decisions
- Case strategy recommendations
- Client billing determinations

#### Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL)
Required for:
- Fraud detection alerts
- Document classification
- Workflow automation
- Performance monitoring

#### Override Mechanisms
All AI systems must provide:
- Clear override procedures
- Audit trail of override events
- Escalation to human experts
- Fallback to manual processes

### Incident Response

#### Automatic Triggers
AIR monitoring automatically triggers response for:
- Evaluation score drops below threshold
- Bias metrics exceed acceptable limits
- Unusual error rates or performance degradation
- Security alerts or suspected attacks
- Compliance framework violations

#### Response Procedures
1. **Alert Generation**: Immediate notification to stakeholders
2. **Tea Spawn**: Automated investigation team deployment
3. **Impact Assessment**: Scope and severity analysis
4. **Containment**: Temporary restrictions or blocking
5. **Remediation**: Fix implementation and testing
6. **Recovery**: Gradual restoration with monitoring
7. **Post-Incident**: Lessons learned and policy updates

### Tea (Sub-Agent) Framework

#### Spawning Criteria
Tea teams automatically spawn for:
- Failed evaluations requiring remediation
- Security incidents needing investigation
- Compliance violations requiring correction
- Performance degradation requiring optimization

#### Standard Team Composition
- **ClaudeGPT-Evaluator**: AI safety and compliance assessment
- **AutoFixer9000**: Automated remediation and patching
- **GovernanceBot**: Policy enforcement and audit trail

#### Lifecycle Management
- **TTL (Time to Live)**: Automatic expiration (24-48 hours typical)
- **Task Assignment**: Specific objectives and success criteria
- **Progress Monitoring**: Regular status updates and milestone tracking
- **Termination**: Graceful shutdown with results documentation

### Monitoring and Metrics

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Compliance Rate**: % of agents meeting all requirements
- **Evaluation Coverage**: % of agents with current assessments
- **Incident Response Time**: Average time to containment
- **False Positive Rate**: Accuracy of automated blocking
- **Bias Metrics**: Fairness across demographic groups

#### Dashboard Components
