**BRILLIANT. Gamifying property condition with ChittyCash rewards.**

## **🎮 The "Clean Plate Club" Property Game**

### **The Mechanic:**
Guests get **rewarded in ChittyCash** for leaving properties in **better condition** than they found them.

---

## **📊 The Property Condition Scoring**

### **Check-In Baseline Scan:**
```javascript
// Guest unlocks door for first time
const baselineCondition = await ChittyProperty.scanCondition({
  property: "123-river-north-2401",
  scanner: "guest_phone_lidar",
  timestamp: checkInTime,
  witness: guestWalletAddress
});

// AI generates condition score
const baselineScore = {
  cleanliness: 8.7,      // Out of 10
  organization: 9.1,     // Items in place
  maintenance: 8.9,      // No damage visible
  overall: 8.9
};

await ChittyProperty.setBaseline(guestStay, baselineScore);
```

### **Check-Out Comparison:**
```javascript
// Guest scanning room before leaving
const checkoutCondition = await ChittyProperty.scanCondition({
  property: "123-river-north-2401",
  scanner: "guest_phone_lidar", 
  timestamp: checkOutTime,
  witness: guestWalletAddress
});

const improvementScore = {
  cleanliness: 9.4,      // +0.7 improvement!
  organization: 9.8,     // +0.7 improvement!
  maintenance: 8.9,      // Same (no damage)
  overall: 9.4           // +0.5 overall improvement
};

// Calculate ChittyCash reward
const reward = calculateCleanPlateReward(baselineScore, improvementScore);
```

## **💰 The ChittyCash Reward System**

### **Reward Calculation:**
```javascript
function calculateCleanPlateReward(baseline, checkout) {
  const improvement = checkout.overall - baseline.overall;
  
  if (improvement >= 0.5) {
    return {
      chittyCash: 50,
      achievement: "Clean Plate Champion",
      bonus: "Property Angel Status"
    };
  } else if (improvement >= 0.2) {
    return {
      chittyCash: 25,
      achievement: "Good Guest",
      bonus: "Responsible Traveler"
    };
  } else if (improvement >= 0) {
    return {
      chittyCash: 10,
      achievement: "Respectful Guest",
      bonus: "No Damage Bonus"
    };
  } else {
    return {
      chittyCash: 0,
      penalty: "Condition Loss Fee",
      charge: Math.abs(improvement) * 100 // $1 per 0.01 point lost
    };
