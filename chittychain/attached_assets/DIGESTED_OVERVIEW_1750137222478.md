# ChittyStacks: Digested & Restructured Overview

## üéØ Core Concept
**ChittyStacks** = Business evolution platform for neurodivergent entrepreneurs that *upcycles* existing tools rather than replacing them.

## üß† The Big Insight
Instead of forcing people to abandon their current systems (QuickBooks, Buildium, etc.), we enhance them with "aftermarket" solutions while gradually preparing for evolution to better systems.
