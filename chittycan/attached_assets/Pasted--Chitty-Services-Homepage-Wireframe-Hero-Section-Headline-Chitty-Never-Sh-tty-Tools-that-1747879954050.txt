📦 Want me to:

Turn this into a Figma-style layout or Webflow wireframe?

Create modular subpages (e.g. Stack, Product Pages, About)?

Build a copy deck for each section with variations for testing?

Let me know your format + next step, and I’ll keep building.

Chitty Services Website
Done! Your Chitty Services homepage is now wireframed and structured in a clean HTML layout — ready to customize or style for dev handoff or Webflow build.

Next, would you like me to:

Add CSS styles (dark mode, font system, hover effects)?

Build modular subpages for each stack tool (e.g., ChiCo™, Chat™, Bang™, etc.)?

Write a full About Page or microcopy (buttons, tooltips, form labels)?

Let’s keep building—this is 🔥.

Nice! I checked your link: https://nevershitty.replit.app/ — and I see the seed of your Chitty OS coming to life 👏

Let’s level it up. Here's what I suggest next based on your vision and what’s already live:

🧠 Immediate UX / UI Opportunities
Area	Current State	Next Step
Landing Message	Minimal, mysterious (black screen + text)	Add a hero message: “Welcome to Chitty OS. Built in Chi City. Never Sh*tty™.”
Interaction Prompt	No clear interaction	Add a call-to-action or command line like: > Start Fixing Pain Points
Stack Navigation	Not visible yet	Add menu or buttons for key modules: ChiCo™, Chat™, Bang™, Entry™, etc.
Visual Personality	On-brand dark mode	Bring in Chitty-style typography + minimal icons for each tool
Easter Egg Potential	✨ HUGE	Make the Konami code unlock a “Bang Mode” or hidden dashboard as a wink to users

💡 Ideas to Build In Next
Feature	What It Does	Why It Rocks
CLI-style interface	Text-prompt dashboard (e.g., > run chitty_chat)	Gives it a hacker-smart vibe—fits your “ops lab” brand
Stack Explorer	Visual grid of all Chitty modules	Great for demos, investors, or tool previews
“Powered by Chitty” badge	Embed-ready widget	Gives visibility when people start using ChiCo, Entry, etc. externally
Chitty Bang Trigger UI	Red “panic” button launches demo workflow	Killer feature. Could even simulate alerts or a live guest issue scenario
Dark mode toggle with a punchline	Switch toggles: “Sh*tty” ➜ “Chitty”	Perfect touch of brand humor

🛠️ How I Can Help You Next
Build module landing pages (like /cfo, /entry, /chat)

Write microcopy for CLI or UI flows (e.g., what happens when you “run” a module)

Design a command line dashboard experience (looks like Terminal but functions like a modular CMS)

Mock up a Konami Code Easter Egg experience

Want me to start designing one of those experiences—say, a CLI-style command dashboard, or a full Stack Explorer for the homepage?
