Add these secrets to your repository settings:

### For All Repos
- `BEACON_ENDPOINT` (optional): Custom beacon endpoint (defaults to https://beacon.cloudeto.com)

### For Cloudflare Deployments
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API token
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID
- `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`: Your zone ID (for cache purging)

### For Vercel Deployments

## ChittyBeacon Integration

All workflows automatically add ChittyBeacon to track:
- Application startups/shutdowns
- Periodic heartbeats (every 5 minutes)
- Platform detection
- Deployment events

### Manual Installation

If you need to add ChittyBeacon manually:

```bash
npm install @chittycorp/app-beacon --save
```

Then add to your entry point:
```javascript
require('@chittycorp/app-beacon');
// or
import '@chittycorp/app-beacon';
```

## Customization

ChittyBeacon supports these environment variables:
- `BEACON_ENDPOINT`: Custom tracking endpoint
- `BEACON_INTERVAL`: Heartbeat interval in ms (default: 300000)
- `BEACON_DISABLED`: Set to 'true' to disable
- `BEACON_VERBOSE`: Set to 'true' for debug output

### Workflow Customization

Modify workflows by editing the `.yml` files and running the setup script again.
