Hi there – how are you both. Checking in to see how review and strategizing is progressing. Also have a couple of questions. How is what i provided
so far, @Joseph Luckett? Here are two additional documents… i extracted and combined imessages, whatsapp and openphone (our phone/crm for
the business) records and data and ran an analysis of 20k+ messages which top line is in one 2024 11 20 Messaging Analysis.docx. The other
2024 11 20 Document x Messaging Analysis.docx is that data set cross referenced against ﬁles/documents/data contained in the folder i’ve been
building. Not sure if either will be helpful even contextually, but enjoy anyhow.
Do i need to have “expert appraisal’s” done? i have not done that except for where required for mortgages during purchase. for the valuations, utilize
the average of the Zillow and Redﬁn estimates. 2024 03 01 Unanimous Consent Valuation.pdf
March Valuation Statement And double checking that i’m only providing LLC leases, double checked the leases colombia is the only active lease
ARIBIA LLC has.
I am working on the P&L but will need more time on that as i’m the acting ceo, admin, marketing manager, leasing agent, maintenance man, cfo,
and beyond.
I pulled the openphone records. i had already pulled those for myself, to show the lack of engagement by luisa.
is a text legally binding?

Timeline of Key Events Related to ARIBIA LLC, Property Investments, and Personal Financial Context
Pre-ARIBIA LLC Background
June 2014 - January 2023: Nicholas Bianchi works for AT&T/DIRECTV, earning wages and building savings through retirement and other
investment accounts.
Initial Investments and Personal Property
November 2019: Nicholas purchases Lakeside Loft (541 W Addison) as his primary residence, which later becomes an investment
property. Renovations are undertaken in August 2023 to increase rental income.
April 2022: Nicholas purchases Cozy Castle (550 W Surf St #504) as a long-term investment. LuLu moves in and pays rent of
approximately $1,200/month. Nicholas holds the mortgage on this property.
Formation and Growth of ARIBIA LLC
July 2022: Nicholas purchases City Studio (550 W Surf St #211) for $100,000 cash and launches ARIBIA LLC to manage real estate
investments and rental properties. LuLu is given equity in ARIBIA LLC with expectations of non-capital contributions, including tenant
relations and project management. Renovations start but are delayed due to Nicholas’s full-time job and LuLu’s lack of engagement.
December 30, 2022: Nicholas and LuLu marry in a private home ceremony officiated by a Thumbtack wedding officiant.
Employment Changes and Business Development
January 6, 2023: Nicholas is laid off from AT&T/DIRECTV, with the final payroll date of January 21, 2023.
January 10, 2023: Nicholas launches Mr. Nice Weird LLC, a marketing and consulting business, investing personal funds into its
development. The business has yet to turn a profit.
Rental Activities and Renovations
June 2023: Nicholas leases Lakeside Loft from ARIBIA LLC, which he signed a property management agreement with to manage the
property. The lease generates rental income for the business and continues until October 31, 2023.
August 2023 - October 2023: Nicholas invests personal funds to contribute to ARIBIA LLC, renovating Lakeside Loft by updating the
bathroom, adding a laundry room, and refreshing the kitchen and living areas to increase potential rental revenue. During this period,
he plans a temporary move to Jacksonville, Florida, in November to stay with his aunt and focus on developing Mr. Nice Weird
LLC and stabilizing ARIBIA LLC’s finances.
November 2023: Nicholas moves into the living room at Cozy Castle, where LuLu resides, as a cost-saving measure.
Expansion and Investment Challenges
May 2023: Nicholas signs property management agreements for Cozy Castle and Lakeside Loftwith ARIBIA LLC.
March - August 2023: Nicholas withdraws approximately $80,000 from his premarital retirement fund + $10,000 from various other
premarital personal savings/investment accounts to contribute to ARIBIA LLC to purchase Morada Mami, an investment property in
Medellín, Colombia. The purchase is based on verbal guarantees from LuLu and Alejandro that they and their family would
consistently pay rent to contribute to ARIBIA LLC’s cash flow. However, rent payments become inconsistent, creating financial strain.

5 of 7

September 2023: LuLu’s brother, Camilo, signs a lease for Morada Mami, with LuLu verbally guaranteeing the rent.
Operational Challenges and Family Contributions
March 2024: Sharon Jones joins ARIBIA LLC as a member and contributes 10,000 for the restructuring of ARIBIA LLC into a series LLC for more
comprehensive asset protection.
March 2024: ARIBIA LLC is restructured into a series LLC with the establishment of multiple series intended to hold properties separately and a
series to handle the property marketing, management, maintenance and inventory management.
April 2024: Alejandro moves into Cozy Castle intending to contribute to ARIBIA LLC, both financially and operationally. Nicholas and
LuLu present Alejandro with an itemized list of expenses for his involvement, but he fails to meet these commitments
June 2024: ARIBIA LLC secures a $100,000 hard money loan to purchase Villa Vista (4343 N Clarendon Ave #1610), with Nicholas
contributing an additional $30,000 from personal funds. Nicholas, LuLu, and Alejandro agree to lease Cozy Castle and move to Villa
Vista, but mid-July, LuLu and Alejandro abandon their roles and commitments, leaving Nicholas responsible for ongoing renovations
at both Cozy Castle and Villa Vista, as well as business operations, tenant management, marketing, and administration.
Financial and Operational Strains
July 15, 2024: LuLu and Alejandro’s abandonment results in significant challenges for Nicholas, who must complete renovations and
operations alone. The failure to deliver Cozy Castle to a tenant on August 1 leads to financial strain, $8,000 in tenant refunds, and
additional expenses.
August 2024: Nicholas makes repeated attempts to resolve financial issues through discussions and proposals to LuLu, including
payment plans and rent reconciliation, but receives no cooperation.
Recent Developments and Financial Overview
October 2024: Multiple formal notices are sent to LuLu regarding unpaid rent for Morada Mamiand requests for cooperation in
positioning the property for sale. Offers for debt reconciliation and incentives to support the sale process are ignored.
November 2024: Renovations at Cozy Castle near completion, and it is relisted for $3,700/month, with the goal of securing a lease by
the end of November. Villa Vista is projected to bring in $2,300-$2,600/month once renovations are complete, though Nicholas must
complete the work himself due to financial constraints.
Key Financial Overview
Ongoing Property Expenses:
Cozy Castle: $2,506.48 in monthly expenses.
City Studio: $659.15 in monthly expenses, generating $1,990 in rental income.
Lakeside Loft: $2,020.46 in monthly expenses, with rental income of $2,600 (increasing to $2,950 in November).
Villa Vista: Estimated $1,748.40+ in monthly expenses, projected to generate $2,300-$2,600 in rental income.
Morada Mami: Financial strain due to $400/month in unpaid rent by tenants.
Overall Financial Status: Nicholas currently has no personal income or savings apart from ARIBIA LLC. He is burdened by ongoing property
expenses, debt incurred to sustain the business, ~$28,000 in 2023 taxes still due, due to the withdraw from his premarital retirement
account to invest in the purchase of Morada Mami, and incomplete commitments from LuLu and Alejandro. ARIBIA LLC - MGMT is behind
on utility payments, HOA payments, Mortgage Payments and Loan payments - as a domino effect from the abandonment of the bussiness
by luisa arias, and subsequent refunds, unrealized revenue, and additional expenses incurred do to the gap in support.
