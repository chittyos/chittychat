Additional Information About This Loan
Loan Disclosures

Assumption
If you sell or transfer this property to another person, your lender
? will allow, under certain conditions, this person to assume this
loan on the original terms.
& will not allow assumption of this loan on the original terms.
Demand Feature
Your loan
? has a demand feature, which permits your lender to require early
repayment of the loan. You should review your note for details.
XI does not have a demand feature.
Late Payment
If your payment is more than 15 days late, your lender will charge a
late fee of 5% of your overdue payment of principal and interest.
Negative Amortization (Increase in Loan Amount)
Under your loan terms, you
? are scheduled to make monthly payments that do not pay all of
the interest due that month. As a result, your loan amount will
increase (negatively amortize), and your loan amount will likely
become larger than your original loan amount. Increases in your
loan amount lower the equity you have in this property.

Escrow Account
For now, your loan
XI will have an escrow account (also called an "impound" or "trust"
account) to pay the property costs listed below. Without an escrow
account, you would pay them directly, possibly in one or two large
payments a year. Your lender may be liable for penalties and interest
for failing to make a payment.

Escrow Waiver Fee

Estimated total amount over year 1. You
must pay these costs directly, possibly in
one or two large payments a year.

In the future,
Your property costs may change and, as a result, your escrow payment may change. You may be able to cancel your escrow account,
but if you do, you must pay your property costs directly. If you fail
to pay your property taxes, your state or local government may (1)
impose fines and penalties or (2) place a tax lien on this property. If
you fail to pay any of your property costs, your lender may (1) add
the amounts to your loan balance, (2) add an escrow account to your
loan, or (3) require you to pay for property insurance that the lender
buys on your behalf, which likely would cost more and provide fewer
benefits than what you could buy on your own.

You may lose this property if you do not make your payments or
satisfy other obligations for this loan.

District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States.

[Property Address]

1. BORROWER'S PROMISE TO PAY
In return for a loan that I have received, I promise to pay U.S. $ 213,750.00
(this amount is
called "Principal"), plus interest, to the order of the Lender. The Lender is SOFI LENDING CORP., A
CORPORATION

I will make all payments under this Note in the form of cash, check or money order.
I understand that the Lender may transfer this Note. The Lender or anyone who takes this Note by transfer and
who is entitled to receive payments under this Note is called the "Note Holder."

2. INTEREST
Interest will be charged on unpaid principal until the full amount of Principal has been paid. I will pay interest
at a yearly rate of
4.500 %.
The interest rate required by this Section 2 is the rate I will pay both before and after any default described in
Section 6(B) of this Note.
3 .P A Y M E N T S
(A) Time and Place of Payments
I will pay principal and interest by making a payment every month.
I will make my monthly payment on the Ist day of each month beginning on
? I will make these payments every month until I have paid all of the principal and interest and any other
charges described below that I may owe under this Note. Each monthly payment will be applied as of its scheduled
due date and will be applied to interest before Principal. If, on May 1, 2052
amounts under this Note, I will pay those amounts in full on that date, which is called the "Maturity Date."
I will make my monthly payments at P.O. BOX 11733, NEWARK, NEW JERSEY 07101-4733
or at a different place if required by the Note Holder.
(B) Amount of Monthly Payments
My monthly payment will be in the amount of U.S. $ 1,083.04

4 . BORROWER'S RIGHT TO PREPAY
I have the right to make payments of Principal at any time before they are due. A payment of Principal only
is known as a "Prepayment." When I make a Prepayment, I will tell the Note Holder in writing that 1 am doing so.
I may not designate a payment as a Prepayment if I have not made all the monthly payments due under the Note.
I may make a full Prepayment or partial Prepayments without paying a Prepayment charge. The Note Holder
will use my Prepayments to reduce the amount of Principal that I owe under this Note. However, the Note Holder
may apply my Prepayment to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment amount, before applying my
Prepayment to reduce the Principal amount of the Note. If I make a partial Prepayment, there will be no changes in
the due date or in the amount of my monthly payment unless the Note Holder agrees in writing to those changes.

5. LOAN CHARGES
If a law, which applies to this loan and which sets maximum loan charges, is finally interpreted so that the
interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with this loan exceed the permitted limits,
then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit;

MULTISTATE FIXED RATE NOTE-Single Family
Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT

Form 3200 1/01

Page 1 of 3

*, DocMagic

and (b) any sums already collected from me which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me. The Note
Holder may choose to make this refund by reducing the Principal I owe under this Note or by making a direct payment
to me. If a refund reduces Principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial Prepayment.

6. BORROWER'S FAILURE TO PAY AS REQUIRED
(A) Late Charge for Overdue Payments
If the Note Holder has not received the full amount of any monthly payment by the end of
calendar days after the date it is due, I will pay a late charge to the Note Holder. The amount of the charge will be
5.000 % of my overdue payment of principal and interest. I will pay this late charge promptly but only
once on each late payment.

(B) Default
If I do not pay the full amount of each monthly payment on the date it is due, I will be in default.
(C) Notice of Default
If I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling me that if I do not pay the overdue
amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require me to pay immediately the full amount of Principal which has
not been paid and all the interest that I owe on that amount. That date must be at least 30 days after the date on which
the notice is mailed to me or delivered by other means.

(D) No Waiver By Note Holder
Even if, at a time when I am in default, the Note Holder does not require me to pay immediately in full as
described above, the Note Holder will still have the right to do so if I am in default at a later time.
(E) Payment of Note Holder's Costs and Expenses
If the Note Holder has required me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note Holder will have
the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this Note to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law. Those expenses include, for example, reasonable attorneys' fees.
7. GIVING OF NOTICES
Unless applicable law requires a different method, any notice that must be given to me under this Note will be
given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to me at the Property Address above or at a different address
if I give the Note Holder a notice of my different address.

Any notice that must be given to the Note Holder under this Note will be given by delivering it or by mailing
it by first class mail to the Note Holder at the address stated in Section 3(A) above or at a different address if I am
given a notice of that different address.

8. OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS UNDER THIS NOTE
If more than one person signs this Note, each person is fully and personally obligated to keep all of the promises

made in this Note, including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person who is a guarantor, surety or
endorser of this Note is also obligated to do these things. Any person who takes over these obligations, including
the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in
this Note. The Note Holder may enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all of
us together. This means that any one of us may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this Note.

9. WAIVERS
I and any other person who has obligations under this Note waive the rights of Presentment and Notice of
"Presentment" means the right to require the Note Holder to demand payment of amounts due. "Notice
of Dishonor" means the right to require the Note Holder to give notice to other persons that amounts due have not

10. UNIFORM SECURED NOTE
This Note is a uniform instrument with limited variations in some jurisdictions. In addition to the protections
given to the Note Holder under this Note, a Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed (the "Security Instrument"),
dated the same date as this Note, protects the Note Holder from possible losses which might result if I do not keep

MULTISTATE FIXED RATE NOTE-Single Family
Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT
Form 3200 1/01

Page 2 of 3

* DocMagic

the promises which I make in this Note. That Security Instrument describes how and under what conditions I may
be required to make immediate payment in full of all amounts I owe under this Note. Some of those conditions are
described as follows:
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower
is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior
written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security
Instrument. However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by
Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall
provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15
within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay
these sums prior to the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this
Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower.

FIXED RATE MORTGAGE
Loan Number: 7012208170

Date: April 26, 2022
Lender: SOFI LENDING CORP. (NMLS # 1121636)
Borrower(s): Nicholas Bianchi

Property Address: 550 W SURF ST #504
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 60657
You are obtaining a mortgage loan that requires private mortgage insurance ("PMI"). PMI protects lenders against certain
financial losses incurred primarily when a borrower defaults.
Under certain circumstances, federal law gives you the right to cancel PMl or requires that PMI automatically terminate. This
disclosure describes when cancellation and termination may occur. Please note that PMI is not the same as property/casualty
insurance (such as homeowner's or flood insurance) which protects you against damage to the property. Cancellation or
termination of PMI does not affect your obligation, if any, to maintain other types of insurance.

In this disclosure, "you" and "your" mean the borrower(s); "loan" means the mortgage loan you are obtaining; and "property"
means the property securing repayment of your loan.

INITIAL AMORTIZATION SCHEDULE: An amortization schedule showing, among other things, the principal and interest
due on your loan, along with the balance remaining after each scheduled payment, is attached for your reference.

BORROWER REQUESTED CANCELLATION OF PMI: You have the right to request that PMI be canceled, at your
option, on either of the following dates (the "cancellation date"):

(1)

(2)

The date the principal balance of your loan is first scheduled to reach 80% of the original value of the property,
based solely on the initial amortization schedule for your loan and irrespective of the outstanding balance of your
loan on that date. This date is
July 1, 2028
? If your loan is subject to a balloon payment,
this date may not be reached before the balloon payment comes due.
The date the principal balance of your loan actually reaches 80% of the original value of the property, based solely
on your actual loan payments.

"Original value" means the lesser of (a) the contract sales price of the property, or (b) the appraised value of the property at
the time the loan is consummated. If the loan is a refinance loan, "original value" means the appraised value of the property
relied upon to approve the loan.

PMI will be canceled on the cancellation date only if you have satisfied all of the following conditions, or any later date that
you have satisfied all of the following conditions:
you submit a written request for PMI cancellation to the servicer of your loan;
(i)
(ii) you have a good payment history;
(in) you are current on your loan payments; and
(Iv) the servicer receives, if the servicer requests and at your expense, (A) evidence satisfactory to the holder of your
loan at the time of your written cancellation request that the property's value has not declined below its original
value, and (B) certification that there are no subordinate liens on the property.

The "servicer" is the person responsible for receiving your loan payments. A "good payment history" means that you have
not made a mortgage payment that was 60 or more days past due during the 12-month period beginning 24 months before, or
you have not made a mortgage payment that was 30 or more days past due within the 12-month period preceding, the later of

EXCEPTIONS TO CANCELLATION AND AUTOMATIC TERMINATION: The cancellation and automatic termination

any payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments are insufficient to bring the Loan current. Lender
may accept any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the Loan current, without waiver of any rights
hereunder or prejudice to its rights to refuse such payment or partial payments in the future, but Lender is not
obligated to apply such payments at the time such payments are accepted. If each Periodic Payment is applied as of
its scheduled due date, then Lender need not pay interest on unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds
until Borrower makes payment to bring the Loan current. If Borrower does not do so within a reasonable period of
time, Lender shall either apply such funds or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such funds will be
applied to the outstanding principal balance under the Note immediately prior to foreclosure. No offset or claim
which Borrower might have now or in the future against Lender shall relieve Borrower from making payments due
under the Note and this Security Instrument or performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security
Instrument.
2. Application of Payments or Proceeds. Except as otherwise described in this Section 2, all payments
accepted and applied by Lender shall be applied in the following order of priority: (a) interest due under the Note;
(b) principal due under the Note; (c) amounts due under Section 3. Such payments shall be applied to each Periodic
Payment in the order in which it became due. Any remaining amounts shall be applied first to late charges, second
to any other amounts due under this Security Instrument, and then to reduce the principal balance of the Note.
If Lender receives a payment from Borrower for a delinquent Periodic Payment which includes a sufficient
amount to pay any late charge due, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and the late charge. If
more than one Periodic Payment is outstanding, Lender may apply any payment received from Borrower to the
repayment of the Periodic Payments if, and to the extent that, each payment can be paid in full. To the extent that
any excess exists after the payment is applied to the full payment of one or more Periodic Payments, such excess may
be applied to any late charges due. Voluntary prepayments shall be applied first to any prepayment charges and then
as described in the Note.
Any application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under the Note
shall not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic Payments.
3. Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due under the
Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum (the "Funds") to provide for payment of amounts due for: (a) taxes and
assessments and other items which can attain priority over this Security Instrument as a lien or encumbrance on the
Property; (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any; (c) premiums for any and all insurance
required by Lender under Section 5; and (d) Mortgage Insurance premiums, if any, or any sums payable by Borrower
to Lender in lieu of the payment of Mortgage Insurance premiums in accordance with the provisions of Section 10
These items are called "Escrow Items." At origination or at any time during the term of the Loan, Lender may require
that Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any, be escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, fees and
assessments shall be an Escrow Item. Borrower shall promptly furnish to Lender all notices of amounts to be paid
under this Section. Borrower shall pay Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives Borrower's
obligation to pay the Funds for any or all Escrow Items. Lender may waive Borrower's obligation to pay to Lender
Funds for any or all Escrow Items at any time. Any such waiver may only be in writing. In the event of such waiver,

Borrower shall pay directly, when and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items for which payment of
Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires, shall furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment
within such time period as Lender may require. Borrower's obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts
shall for all purposes be deemed to be a covenant and agreement contained in this Security Instrument, as the phrase
"covenant and agreement" is used in Section 9. If Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, pursuant to
a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section
9 and pay such amount and Borrower shall then be obligated under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such amount.
Lender may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any time by a notice given in accordance with Section
15 and, upon such revocation, Borrower shall pay to Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required
under this Section 3.
Lender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount (a) sufficient to permit Lender to apply the Funds
at the time specified under RESPA, and (b) not to exceed the maximum amount a lender can require under RESPA.
Lender shall estimate the amount of Funds due on the basis of current data and reasonable estimates of expenditures
of future Escrow Items or otherwise in accordance with Applicable Law.

The Funds shall be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality, or
entity (including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) or in any Federal Home Loan
Bank. Lender shall apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time specified under RESPA. Lender
shall not charge Borrower for holding and applying the Funds, annually analyzing the escrow account, or verifying
the Escrow Items, unless Lender pays Borrower interest on the Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make
such a charge. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds,
Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the Funds. Borrower and Lender can agree
in writing, however, that interest shall be paid on the Funds. Lender shall give to Borrower, without charge, an
annual accounting of the Funds as required by RESPA.
If there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA, Lender shall account to Borrower for
the excess funds in accordance with RESPA. If there is a shortage of Funds held in escrow, as defined under RESPA,

shall pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the deficiency in accordance with RESPA, but in no more than
12 monthly payments.
Upon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall promptly refund to Borrower

any Funds held by Lender.
4. Charges; Liens. Borrower shall pay all taxes, assessments, charges, fines, and impositions attributable to
the Property which can attain priority over this Security Instrument, leasehold payments or ground rents on the
Property, if any, and Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any. To the extent that these items
are Escrow Items, Borrower shall pay them in the manner provided in Section 3.
Borrower shall promptly discharge any lien which has priority over this Security Instrument unless Borrower:
(a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to Lender, but only
so long as Borrower is performing such agreement; (b) contests the lien in good faith by, or defends against
enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which in Lender's opinion operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien
while those proceedings are pending, but only until such proceedings are concluded; or (c) secures from the holder

of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender subordinating the lien to this Security Instrument. If Lender
determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien which can attain priority over this Security Instrument,
Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Within 10 days of the date on which that notice is given,
Borrower shall satisfy the lien or take one or more of the actions set forth above in this Section 4.
Lender may require Borrower to pay a one-time charge for a real estate tax verification and/or reporting service
used by Lender in connection with this Loan.
5. Property Insurance. Borrower shall keep the improvements now existing or hereafter erected on the
Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term "extended coverage," and any other hazards

ILLINOIS - Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT - MERS
Form 3014 1/01

including, but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, for which Lender requires insurance. This insurance shall be
maintained in the amounts (including deductible levels) and for the periods that Lender requires. What Lender
requires pursuant to the preceding sentences can change during the term of the Loan. The insurance carrier providing
the insurance shall be chosen by Borrower subject to Lender's right to disapprove Borrower's choice, which right shall
not be exercised unreasonably. Lender may require Borrower to pay, in connection with this Loan, either: (a) a onetime charge for flood zone determination, certification and tracking services; or (b) a one-time charge for flood zone
determination and certification services and subsequent charges each time remappings or similar changes occur which

reasonably might affect such determination or certification. Borrower shall also be responsible for the payment of
any fees imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the review of any flood zone
determination resulting from an objection by Borrower.
If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at
Lender's option and Borrower's expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any particular type or amount
of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might or might not protect Borrower, Borrower's
equity in the Property, or the contents of the Property, against any risk, hazard or liability and might provide greater
or lesser coverage than was previously in effect. Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so
obtained might significantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed
by Lender under this Section 5 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These
amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest,
upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.
All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to Lender's right to
disapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an

additional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the policies and renewal certificates. If Lender requires,
Borrower shall promptly give to Lender all receipts of paid premiums and renewal notices. If Borrower obtains any
form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or destruction of, the Property, such
policy shall include a standard mortgage clause and shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender. Lender may make

proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise agree in writing, any
insurance proceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender, shall be applied to restoration
or repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender's security is not lessened
During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender
has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction,

provided that such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and
restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement
is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such insurance proceeds, Lender shall not be
required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such proceeds. Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties,
retained by Borrower shall not be paid out of the insurance proceeds and shall be the sole obligation of Borrower.
If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender's security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds
shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid
to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.
If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available insurance claim and
related matters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the insurance carrier has

offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day period will begin when the
notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under Section 22 or otherwise, Borrower hereby
assigns to Lender (a) Borrower's rights to any insurance proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid
under the Note or this Security Instrument, and (b) any other of Borrower's rights (other than the right to any refund
of unearned premiums paid by Borrower) under all insurance policies covering the Property, insofar as such rights
are applicable to the coverage of the Property. Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the
Property or to pay amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.

6 . Occupancy. Borrower shall occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower's principal residence
within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and shall continue to occupy the Property as Borrower's
principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond Borrower's

7. Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property; Inspections. Borrower shall not destroy,
damage or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate or commit waste on the Property. Whether or not
Borrower is residing in the Property, Borrower shall maintain the Property in order to prevent the Property from
deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its condition. Unless it is determined pursuant to Section 5 that repair or
restoration is not economically feasible, Borrower shall promptly repair the Property if damaged to avoid further
deterioration or damage. If insurance or condemnation proceeds are paid in connection with damage to, or the taking
of, the Property, Borrower shall be responsible for repairing or restoring the Property only if Lender has released
proceeds for such purposes. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in
a series of progress payments as the work is completed. If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient
to repair or restore the Property, Borrower is not relieved of Borrower's obligation for the completion of such repair
or restoration.
Lender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property. If it has reasonable cause,
Lender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property. Lender shall give Borrower notice at the time
of or prior to such an interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause.

8. Borrower's Loan Application. Borrower shall be in default if, during the Loan application process,
Borrower or any persons or entities acting at the direction of Borrower or with Borrower's knowledge or consent gave

materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with
material information) in connection with the Loan. Material representations include, but are not limited to,
representations concerning Borrower's occupancy of the Property as Borrower's principal residence.
9. Protection of Lender's Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument. If (a)
Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, (b) there is a legal
proceeding that might significantly affect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument
(such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien which may
attain priority over this Security Instrument or to enforce laws or regulations), or (c) Borrower has abandoned the
Property, then Lender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender's interest in the
Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value of the Property,
and securing and/or repairing the Property. Lender's actions can include, but are not limited to: (a) paying any sums
secured by a lien which has priority over this Security Instrument; (b) appearing in court; and (c) paying reasonable
attorneys' fees to protect its interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including its secured
position in a bankruptcy proceeding. Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, entering the Property to
make repairs, change locks, replace or board up doors and windows, drain water from pipes, eliminate building or
other code violations or dangerous conditions, and have utilities turned on or off. Although Lender may take action
under this Section 9, Lender does not have to do so and is not under any duty or obligation to do so. It is agreed that
Lender incurs no liability for not taking any or all actions authorized under this Section 9.
Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this
Security Instrument. These amounts shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be
payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.

If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower shall comply with all the provisions of the lease.
Borrower shall not surrender the leasehold estate and interests herein conveyed or terminate or cancel the ground lease.

Borrower shall not, without the express written consent of Lender, alter or amend the ground lease. If Borrower
acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title shall not merge unless Lender agrees to the merger

in writing.

10. Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan, Borrower
shall pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. If, for any reason, the Mortgage

Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases to be available from the mortgage insurer that previously provided such
insurance and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage

Insurance, Borrower shall pay the premiums required to obtain coverage substantially equivalent to the Mortgage
Insurance previously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance
previously in effect, from an alternate mortgage insurer selected by Lender. If substantially equivalent Mortgage
Insurance coverage is not available, Borrower shall continue to pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated
payments that were due when the insurance coverage ceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use and retain these
payments as a non-refundable loss reserve in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve shall be non-refundable,
notwithstanding the fact that the Loan is ultimately paid in full, and Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any
interest or earnings on such loss reserve. Lender can no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance
coverage (in the amount and for the period that Lender requires) provided by an insurer selected by Lender again

becomes available, is obtained, and Lender requires separately designated payments toward the premiums for
Mortgage Insurance. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan and Borrower was
required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower shall pay
the premiums required to maintain Mortgage Insurance in effect, or to provide a non-refundable loss reserve, until
Lender providing for such termination or until termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Section
10 affects Borrower's obligation to pay interest at the rate provided in the Note.
Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender (or any entity that purchases the Note) for certain losses it may incur

if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage Insurance.
Mortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may enter into
agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. These agreements are on terms and
conditions that are satisfactory to the mortgage insurer and the other party (or parties) to these agreements. These
agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source of funds that the mortgage insurer
may have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage Insurance premiums).
As a result of these agreements, Lender, any purchaser of the Note, another insurer, any reinsurer, any other
entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that derive from (or might
be characterized as) a portion of Borrower's payments for Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for sharing or modifying

such agreements
Further: will not affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for Mortgage
Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan. Such agreements will not increase the amount Borrower will owe
for Mortgage Insurance, and they will not entitle Borrower to any refund.
(b) Any such agreements will not affect the rights Borrower has - if any - with respect to the Mortgage
Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 or any other law. These rights may include the right
to reccive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of the Mortgage Insurance, to have the
Mortgage Insurance terminated automatically, and/or to receive a refund of any Mortgage Insurance premiums

damaged, such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to restoration or repair of the Property,
if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and Lender's security is not lessened. During such repair and
restoration period, Lender shall have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds until Lender has had an
opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction, provided that
such inspection shall be undertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration in a single disbursement
or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable
Law requires interest to be paid on such Miscellaneous Proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any

interest or earnings on such Miscellaneous Proceeds. If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or

Lender's security would be lessened, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security
Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds shall

be applied in the order provided for in Section 2.

In the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be
applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to
Borrower.

In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of
the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is equal to or greater than the amount
of the sums secured by this Security Instrument immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value,
unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, the sums secured by this Security Instrument shall be reduced
by the amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds multiplied by the following fraction: (a) the total amount of the sums
secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value divided by (b) the fair market value of the
Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value. Any balance shall be paid to Borrower.
In the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property in which the fair market value of
the Property immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value is less than the amount of the sums
secured immediately before the partial taking, destruction, or loss in value, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise
agree in writing, the Miscellaneous Proceeds shall be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument whether
or not the sums are then due.
If the Property is abandoned by Borrower, or if, after notice by Lender to Borrower that the Opposing Party (as
defined in the next sentence) offers to make an award to settle a claim for damages, Borrower fails to respond to
Lender within 30 days after the date the notice is given, Lender is authorized to collect and apply the Miscellaneous
Proceeds either to restoration or repair of the Property or to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether
or not then due. "Opposing Party" means the third party that owes Borrower Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party
against whom Borrower has a right of action in regard to Miscellaneous Proceeds.
Borrower shall be in default if any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, is begun that, in Lender's
judgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's interest in the Property
or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a default and, if acceleration has occurred, reinstate
as provided in Section 19, by causing the action or proceeding to be dismissed with a ruling that, in Lender's
judgment, precludes forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's interest in the Property or
rights under this Security Instrument. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages that are attributable to the
impairment of Lender's interest in the Property are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender.
All Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property shall be applied in the
order provided for in Section 2.

12. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance By Lender Not a Waiver. Extension of the time for payment or
modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Lender to Borrower or any
Successor in Interest of Borrower shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower or any Successors in Interest
of Borrower. Lender shall not be required to commence proceedings against any Successor in Interest of Borrower
or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security
Instrument by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any

forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy including, without limitation, Lender's acceptance of
payments from third persons, entities or Successors in Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then
due, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy.

13. Joint and Several Liability; Co-signers; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower covenants and agrees
that Borrower's obligations and liability shall be joint and several. However, any Borrower who co-signs this Security
Instrument but does not execute the Note (a "co-signer"): (a) is co-signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage,

grant and convey the co-signer's interest in the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not
personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other
Borrower can agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security
Instrument or the Note without the co-signer's consent.

ILLINOIS - Single Family - Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT - MERS

* DocMagic

Subject to the provisions of Section 18, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes Borrower's
obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, shall obtain all of Borrower's rights
and benefits under this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be released from Borrower's obligations and liability
under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in writing. The covenants and agreements of this
Security Instrument shall bind (except as provided in Section 20) and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender.
14. Loan Charges. Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with Borrower's
default, for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument,
including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees, property inspection and valuation fees. In regard to any other fees, the
absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific fee to Borrower shall not be construed
as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security

Instrument or by Applicable Law.
If the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so that the
interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the permitted limits,
then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit;
and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to Borrower.
Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment
to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any
prepayment charge (whether or not a prepayment charge is provided for under the Note). Borrower's acceptance of
any such refund made by direct payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might
have arising out of such overcharge.
15. Notices. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must be in
writing. Any notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to
Borrower when mailed by first class mail or when actually delivered to Borrower's notice address if sent by other
means. Notice to any one Borrower shall constitute notice to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law expressly requires
otherwise. The notice address shall be the Property Address unless Borrower has designated a substitute notice
address by notice to Lender.Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of Borrower's change of address. If Lender
specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower's change of address, then Borrower shall only report a change of address
through that specified procedure. There may be only one designated notice address under this Security Instrument

at any one time. Any notice to Lender shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to Lender's
address stated herein unless Lender has designated another address by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection
with this Security Instrument shall not be deemed to have been given to Lender until actually received by Lender.
If any notice required by this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law
requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument.
16. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument shall be governed by
federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located. All rights and obligations contained in
this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of Applicable Law. Applicable Law might
explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree by contract or it might be silent, but such silence shall not be
construed as a prohibition against agreement by contract. In the event that any provision or clause of this Security
Instrument or the Note conflicts with Applicable Law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security
Instrument or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provision.
As used in this Security Instrument: (a) words of the masculine gender shall mean and include corresponding
neuter words or words of the feminine gender; (b) words in the singular shall mean and include the plural and vice
versa; and (c) the word "may" gives sole discretion without any obligation to take any action.
17. Borrower's Copy. Borrower shall be given one copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.
18. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. As used in this Section 18, "Interest in
the Property" means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited to, those beneficial
interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales contract or escrow agreement, the intent
of which is the transfer of title by Borrower at a future date to a purchaser.

Loan Number: 7012208170

If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a
natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior written consent,
Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option
shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice shall provide a
period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower
must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of
this
period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand
on Borrower.
19. Borrower's Right to Reinstate After Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions, Borrower shall
have the right to have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued at any time prior to the earliest of: (a)
five days before sale of the Property pursuant to Section 22 of this Security Instrument; (b) such other period as
Applicable Law might specify for the termination of Borrower's right to reinstate; or (c) entry of a judgment enforcing
this Security Instrument. Those conditions are that Borrower: (a) pays Lender all sums which then would be due
under this Security Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred; (b) cures any default of any other
covenants or agreements; (c) pays all expenses incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument, including, but not
limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, property inspection and valuation fees, and other fees incurred for the purpose

Instrument, and Borrower's obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument, shall continue unchanged
unless as otherwise provided under Applicable Law. Lender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement sums
and expenses in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified
check, bank check, treasurer's check or cashier's check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose

deposits are insured by a federal agency, instrumentality or entity; or (d) Electronic Funds Transfer. Upon
reinstatement by Borrower, this Security Instrument and obligations secured hereby shall remain fully effective as if
no acceleration had occurred. However, this right to reinstate shall not apply in the case of acceleration under Section 18.

20. Sale of Note; Change of Loan Servicer; Notice of Grievance. The Note or a partial interest in the Note
(together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower. A sale might
result in a change in the entity (known as the "Loan Servicer") that collects Periodic Payments due under the Note
and this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations under the Note, this Security
Instrument, and Applicable Law. There also might be one or more changes of the Loan Servicer unrelated to a sale
of the Note. If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written notice of the change which will
state the name and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to which payments should be made and any other
information RESPA requires in connection with a notice of transfer of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter
the Loan is serviced by a Loan Servicer other than the purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing obligations
to Borrower will remain with the Loan Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not assumed
by the Note purchaser unless otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.
Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an individual
Jitigant or the member of a class) that arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this Security Instrument or that
alleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by reason of, this Security Instrument,
until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (with such notice given in compliance with the requirements
of Section 15) of such alleged breach and afforded the other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such
notice to take corrective action. If Applicable Law provides a time period which must elapse before certain action

can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this paragraph.
acceleration and opportunity to cure given to Borrower pursuant to Section 22 and the notice of acceleration given
to Borrower pursuant to Section 18 shall be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action
provisions of this Section 20.

21. Hazardous Substances. As used in this Section 21: (a) "Hazardous Substances" are those substances
defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law and the following substances:
gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents,
materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, and radioactive materials; (b) "Environmental Law" means federal
laws and laws of the jurisdiction where the Property is located that relate to health, safety or environmental protection;

(c) "Environmental Cleanup" includes any response action, remedial action, or removal action, as defined in
Environmental Law; and (d) an "Environmental Condition" means a condition that can cause, contribute to, or
otherwise trigger an Environmental Cleanup.
Borrower shall not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous Substances,
or threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property. Borrower shall not do, nor allow anyone else

to do, anything affecting the Property (a) that is in violation of any Environmental Law, (b) which creates an
Environmental Condition, or (c) which, due to the presence, use, or release of a Hazardous Substance, creates a
condition that adversely affects the value of the Property. The preceding two sentences shall not apply to the
presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized

to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property (including, but not limited to,
hazardous substances in consumer products).

Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of (a) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit or other
action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any Hazardous Substance
or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge, (b) any Environmental Condition, including but not

limited to, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance, and (c) any
condition caused by the presence, use or release of a Hazardous Substance which adversely affects the value of the
Property. If Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority, or any private party, that
any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower shall
promptly take all necessary remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law. Nothing herein shall create any
obligation on Lender for an Environmental Cleanup.

NON-UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:
22. Acceleration; Remedies. Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following
Borrower's breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument (but not prior to acceleration under
Section 18 unless Applicable Law provides otherwise). The notice shall specify: (a) the default; (b) the action
required to cure the default; (c) a date, not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given to Borrower, by
which the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the default on or before the date specified in the
notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured by this Security Instrument, foreclosure by judicial
proceeding and sale of the Property. The notice shall further inform Borrower of the right to reinstate after
acceleration and the right to assert in the foreclosure proceeding the non-existence of a default or any other
defense of Borrower to acceleration and foreclosure. If the default is not cured on or before the date specified
in the notice, Lender at its option may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security
Instrument without further demand and may foreclose this Security Instrument by judicial proceeding. Lender
shall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this Section 22, including,
but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of title evidence.
23. Release. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender shall release this Security
Instrument. Borrower shall pay any recordation costs. Lender may charge Borrower a fee for releasing this Security
Instrument, but only if the fee is paid to a third party for services rendered and the charging of the fee is permitted

under Applicable Law.
24. Waiver of Homestead. In accordance with Illinois law, the Borrower hereby releases and waives all rights
under and by virtue of the Illinois homestead exemption laws.

25. Placement of Collateral Protection Insurance. Unless Borrower provides Lender with evidence of the
insurance coverage required by Borrower's agreement with Lender, Lender may purchase insurance at Borrower's
expense to protect Lender's interests in Borrower's collateral. This insurance may, but need not, protect Borrower's
interests. The coverage that Lender purchases may not pay any claim that Borrower makes or any claim that is made
against Borrower in connection with the collateral. Borrower may later cancel any insurance purchased by Lender,
but only after providing Lender with evidence that Borrower has obtained insurance as required by Borrower's and
Lender's agreement. If Lender purchases insurance for the collateral, Borrower will be responsible for the costs of
that insurance, including interest and any other charges Lender may impose in connection with the placement of the
insurance, until the effective date of the cancellation or expiration of the insurance. The costs of the insurance may
be added to Borrower's total outstanding balance or obligation. The costs of the insurance may be more than the cost
of insurance Borrower may be able to obtain on its own.
BY SIGNING BELOW, Borrower accepts and agrees to the terms and covenants contained in this Security
Instrument and in any Rider executed by Borrower and recorded with it.

Loan Number: 7012208170

THIS CONDOMINIUM RIDER is made this 26th day of
and is incorporated into and shall be deemed to amend and supplement the Mortgage,
April, 2022
Deed of Trust, or
Security Deed (the "Security Instrument") of the same date given by the undersigned (the "Borrower") to
secure Borrower's Note to SOFI LENDING CORP., A CORPORATION
(the "Lender") of the same date and covering the Property described in the Security Instrument and located at:
550 W SURF ST #504, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 60657
[Property Address]

The Property includes a unit in, together with an undivided interest in the common elements of, a
condominium project known as:
COMMODORE GREEN BRIER LANDMARK CONDO ASSN
(Name of Condominium Project]

(the "Condominium Project"). If the owners association or other entity which acts for the Condominium
Project (the "Owners Association") holds title to property for the benefit or use of its members or
shareholders, the Property also includes Borrower's interest in the Owners Association and the uses, proceeds
and benefits of Borrower's interest.

CONDOMINIUM COVENANTS. In addition to the covenants and agreements made in the Security
Instrument, Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:
A. Condominium Obligations. Borrower shall perform all of Borrower's obligations under the
Condominium Project's Constituent Documents. The "Constituent Documents" are the: (i) Declaration or
any other document which creates the Condominium Project; (ii) by-laws; (iii) code of regulations; and (iv)
other equivalent documents. Borrower shall promptly pay, when due, all dues and assessments imposed
pursuant to the Constituent Documents.

B. Property Insurance. So long as the Owners Association maintains, with a generally accepted
insurance carrier, a "master" or "blanket" policy on the Condominium Project which is satisfactory to Lender
and which provides insurance coverage in the amounts (including deductible levels), for the periods, and
against loss by fire, hazards included within the term "extended coverage," and any other hazards, including,
but not limited to, earthquakes and floods, from which Lender requires insurance, then: (i) Lender waives

the provision in Section 3 for the Periodic Payment to Lender of the yearly premium installments for
property insurance on the Property; and (ii) Borrower's obligation under Section 5 to maintain property
insurance coverage on the Property is deemed satisfied to the extent that the required coverage is provided

by the Owners Association policy.
What Lender requires as a condition of this waiver can change during the term of the loan.

Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT
Form 3140 1/01

* DocMagic
Page 1 of 3

Borrower shall give Lender prompt notice of any lapse in required property insurance coverage provided

by the master or blanket policy.

In the event of a distribution of property insurance proceeds in lieu of restoration or repair following
a loss to the Property, whether to the unit or to common elements, any proceeds payable to Borrower are
hereby assigned and shall be paid to Lender for application to the sums secured by the Security Instrument,
whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower.

C. Public Liability Insurance. Borrower shall take such actions as may be reasonable to insure
that the Owners Association maintains a public liability insurance policy acceptable in form, amount, and
extent of coverage to Lender.

D. Condemnation. The proceeds of any award or claim for damages, direct or consequential,
payable to Borrower in connection with any condemnation or other taking of all or any part of the Property,
whether of the unit or of the common elements, or for any conveyance in lieu of condemnation, are hereby
assigned and shall be paid to Lender. Such proceeds shall be applied by Lender to the sums secured by the
Security Instrument as provided in Section 11

E. Lender's Prior Consent. Borrower shall not, except after notice to Lender and with Lender's
prior written consent, either partition or subdivide the Property or consent to: (i) the abandonment or
termination of the Condominium Project, except for abandonment or termination required by law in the case
of substantial destruction by fire or other casualty or in the case of a taking by condemnation or eminent
domain; (ii) any amendment to any provision of the Constituent Documents if the provision is for the express
benefit of Lender; (ili) termination of professional management and assumption of self-management of the
Owners Association; or (iv) any action which would have the effect of rendering the public liability insurance
coverage maintained by the Owners Association unacceptable to Lender.

F. Remedies. If Borrower does not pay condominium dues and assessments when due, then Lender
may pay them. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this paragraph F shall become additional debt of
Borrower secured by the Security Instrument. Unless Borrower and Lender agree to other terms of payment,
these amounts shall bear interest from the date of disbursement at the Note rate and shall be payable, with
interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.

The mortgage agreement that you have entered into has an escrow account provision. In this escrow account 1/12th
of your yearly property tax and 1/12th of your yearly hazard insurance premium will be deposited monthly from your
mortgage payment. Each year this account will be analyzed to assure that the proper dollar amount is being collected
each month in your mortgage payment to pay the current year's property tax bill and the current year's hazard
insurance premium. The lender will review the two most recent property tax bills and the most recent hazard
insurance premium for your property and compare these with the funds held in your escrow account for that purpose.
If it is determined that an increase in your monthly escrow payment is needed, you will receive written notification
from the mortgage lender within thirty (30) days prior to the date of such increase. This notification will contain the
mortgage lender's calculation method of the new escrow figure.

Borrower(s): Nicholas Bianchi

Property Address: 550 W SURF ST #504
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 60657
An Act to regulate certain practices of mortgage lenders in the administration of escrow accounts.
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, represented in the General Assembly:
Section 1. This Act shall be known as the "Mortgage Escrow Account Act".

Section 2. As used in this Act, unless the context requires otherwise:

(a) "Escrow Account" means any account established by the mortgage lender in conjunction with a mortgage loan on a
residence, into which the borrower is required to make regular periodic payments and out of which the lender pays the
taxes on the property covered by the mortgage.
(b) "Borrower" means the person obligated under the mortgage loan.
(c) "Mortgage Lender" means any bank, savings bank, savings and loan association, credit union, mortgage banker, or other
institution, association, partnership, corporation or person who extends the loan of monies for the purpose of enabling
another to purchase a residence or who services the loan, including successors in interest of the foregoing.
"Escrow-like Arrangement" means any arrangement the intent of which is to serve the same purposes as an escrow account
but which does not require the formal establishment of an account.

Section 3. Escrow Accounts or escrow-like arrangements established after the effective date of this Act in conjunction with
mortgage agreements for single-family owner occupied residential property are hereby declared separate and distinct
transactions from mortgages and, hence, subject to the laws and regulations of this State.

Section 4. On or after the effective date of this Act, each mortgage lender in conjunction with the granting or servicing of
a mortgage on a single-family owner occupied residential property, shall comply with the provisions of this Act.

Section 5. When the mortgage is reduced to 65% of its original amount by payments of the borrower, timely made according
to the provisions of the loan agreement secured by the mortgage, and the borrower is otherwise not in default on the loan
agreement, the mortgage lender must notify the borrower that he may terminate such escrow account or that he may elect to
continue it until he requests a termination thereof, or until the mortgage is paid in full, whichever occurs first.
Section 6. In lieu of the mortgage lender establishing an escrow account or an escrow-like arrangement, a borrower may pledge
an interest bearing time deposit with the mortgage lender in an amount sufficient to secure the payment of anticipated taxes.
