Terms of Repayment
a. Payments
The outstanding Loan Amount shall accrue interest at an annual rate equal to 4.66 percent ("Interest
Rate") from the date of this Agreement until the entire Loan Amount is paid in full, whether at
maturity, upon acceleration, by prepayment, or otherwise.
The Borrower shall pay the Loan Amount at the Interest Rate in monthly installments of $1,135.40,

remaining unpaid principal and interest shall be due in full

All payments on this Agreement shall be applied first in payment of accrued interest and any
remainder in payment of principal.
c. Late Fee
The Borrower promises to pay a late charge of $60.00 for each installment that remains unpaid more
than ten day(s) after its Due Date. This late charge shall be paid as liquidated damages in lieu of

be construed to cure any default arising from or relating to such late payment.

entitled to a discount equal to 10 percent of the unpaid principal that existed immediately prior to

III. Prepayment
The Borrower reserves the right to prepay this loan (in whole or in part) prior to the Due Date with no
prepayment penalty. Any such prepayment shall be applied against the installments of principal due under
this Agreement in the inverse order of their maturity and shall be accompanied by payment of accrued
interest on the amount prepaid to the date of prepayment.
IV. Collection Costs
If any payment obligation under this Agreement is not paid when due, the Borrower promises to pay all costs
of collection, including reasonable attorney fees, whether or not a lawsuit is commenced as part of the
