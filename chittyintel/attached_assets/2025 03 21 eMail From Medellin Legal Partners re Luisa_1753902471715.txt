Lease Agreement - 06_01_2023.pdf, Image.png

Hi Mariana,
Thank you for your update. I appreciate the clarity regarding the tenants’ position and the legal
processes required. Based on your response, I will proceed with:
1. Engaging litigation counsel to file both the Restitution of Leased Property (Proceso de
Restitución de Inmueble Arrendado) and the Executive Process for Debt Collection
(Proceso Ejecutivo).
2. Confirming asset retrieval rights for ARIBIA LLC’s items in the property and including
this in legal filings if necessary.
3. Filing the executive process to ensure the tenants’ financial delinquency is formally
pursued through the court system
4. Delaying the property sale until eviction is finalized while assessing alternative strategies
for listing.
Additionally, I’m attaching the executed lease agreement for Cozy Castle, which Luisa entered
into as her personal residence, leasing directly from ARIBIA LLC in the U.S.
Her recent claim that prior rent payments should be applied to Morada Mami is factually and
legally incorrect for several reasons:
- Some of payments were made before ARIBIA LLC even purchased the property in
Medellín, meaning they have no possible connection to Morada Mami.
- The payments were made directly into the Cozy Castle account, where she signed a lease
and resided—they were properly recorded and applied.
- Cozy Castle remains in arrears by $18,750.34, meaning any reallocation attempt is
irrelevant; there is still an unpaid balance.
- She is attempting to shift payments now that she no longer occupies Cozy Castle, further
demonstrating bad faith in avoiding her obligations.

Asset Retrieval – Proof of ARIBIA LLC Ownership
Regarding the refrigerator and washer, I have the cash withdrawal receipt (attached) from
Alianza that shows the funds used to purchase them. If Camilo is claiming ownership, I would
ask:
With what money? He has no financial record of purchasing these items, whereas ARIBIA
LLC does.
This proves beyond doubt that these assets belong to ARIBIA LLC, and his claim is
simply an attempt to obstruct recovery.
What is the best legal strategy to ensure asset retrieval is enforced during the eviction
process?
Pre-Litigation Measures to Strengthen Eviction
To avoid any procedural delays during litigation, I want to ensure that all possible pre-litigation
measures are in place to validate the lease and eliminate potential objections. Can you confirm
the best approach for the following:
Notarized Certification of Lease Validity - issuing a certified notarized document
confirming the lease’s validity help preemptively counter any claims that the contract was
“simulated”?
Pre-Litigation Notice of Lease Enforcement (Notificación Previa de Cumplimiento de
Contrato) - Would sending a formal lease enforcement notice before court filings help
strengthen the eviction case by documenting the tenants’ contractual breach?
Public Notice of Legal Enforcement (Edicto Público, if necessary)
If the tenants refuse to accept formal legal notifications, should we consider a public notice
(Edicto Público) to ensure procedural compliance and avoid claims of improper service?
I will proceed with litigation engagement as recommended, but I want to ensure that all
preventative legal measures are in place to keep the process moving efficiently. Let me know if
you recommend any additional steps before the Restitution of Leased Property and Executive
Process for Debt Collection are formally initiated.

Thanks again for your assistance.

Best,
Nick Bianchi
President, ARIBIA LLC

Subject: Fw: Updated ARIBIA LLC Valuation Statement & Acknowledgment Request

Hi Nick,
I hope you are doing well.
Through this email, we would like to update you on Camilo and Pilar’s
position and clarify your concerns.
Camilo and Pilar have decided not to sign the agreement, as they deny the
validity of the lease contract, claiming that it was simulated for tax purposes
and visa procedures. They state that the apartment was purchased by ARIBIA
LLC and that Luisa placed them there with your knowledge. They refuse to
negotiate or settle and prefer to wait for a judge’s decision in the U.S. before
taking any action in Colombia, despite being aware of the legal
consequences.
Attached, you will find all the files they sent us:
• They provided payment receipts and deposits in your favor, claiming that
the outstanding debt amount is incorrect and that those payments were not
considered.
• They sent a receipt for the purchase of a washing machine and refrigerator.
Camilo argues that he purchased them, as shown on the invoice, and therefore
refuses to allow entry to remove them from the apartment.
• They submitted conversations where they claim to have proof that the lease
contract was simulated and is not valid.
Our legal recommendation is to initiate both the eviction process (Restitution
4 of 29

of Leased Property) and the executive process (debt collection). Both parties
are firmly holding onto their positions, and the most appropriate way to
resolve the dispute is for each side to present its case in legal proceedings, as
reaching an agreement seems unfeasible.
Regarding your question: Has the “Restitution of Leased Property” process
(eviction request) been formally initiated? If not, what is preventing
immediate action?—Our firm does not provide litigation services for judicial
proceedings, so we cannot initiate a process that we are unable to continue.
These matters require a formal lawsuit, which will be handled by other
attorneys.
Their argument about the lease contract’s validity will have to be proven in
court. You have every right and the option to start the legal process with the
appropriate attorneys, and they will have to defend their argument during the
proceedings. Their claim does not prevent you from filing a lawsuit.
Regarding the sale of the property, as we have advised, the best approach is
to wait for a ruling in favor of the eviction process. At this point, any actions
related to the property, such as entry, will be challenging since Camilo and
Pilar are firm in their stance. The best course of action is to wait for the
process to conclude and, once a judgment is obtained, proceed with all
necessary steps for the sale.
On credit reporting: An individual cannot report someone to Datacrédito.
Debt delinquency must be handled through an executive process, where a
judge can order asset and financial account seizures.
Conclusion:
• No agreement was reached.
• The recommended course of action is to initiate an executive process to
recover the debt and a restitution of leased property (eviction) process to
regain possession of the property.

will not be involved in the process:
• Attorney Andrés Guzmán: Guzman9026@hotmail.com

Once again
A reminder that per your specific directions, the $400 rent for Medellin were
deposited every month in the portal TurboTenant, in the 550 W Surf St Apt 504 board,
in order for you to keep doing your shady accounting moves and your disastrous
management decisions. The payments from our part were made.
The balance of the rent, “magically” passed from $800 to $4.000 in your emails in
the last weeks Showing your inconsistency in terms of your narrative and your lack of
transparency.
I remind you that what is claimed in the email that precedes this communication,
lacks coherence, certainty and doesn’t reflect the reality.
Here get proven, once again, your lack of integrity and honesty.

Dear Luisa,
Thank you for your message. I understand your concerns regarding the recent valuation and
your responsibilities within ARIBIA LLC. In light of these concerns, I would like to clarify
several points and provide additional context and documentation to ensure transparency and
accuracy regarding the company’s current financial situation and your contributions.
1. Transparency and Integrity of the Valuation Process
The most recent valuation of ARIBIA LLC, conducted on September 14, 2024, was
performed based on the company’s financial records, property management agreements,
and income generated from the properties under management. This valuation follows the
same methodology outlined in the Unanimous Consent Valuation Method (March 1,
2024), which was agreed upon by all members. The company’s current value stands at
$137,120, calculated using the income approach, which is consistent with prior
evaluations and reflects the company’s actual operational and financial performance.
Please refer to the attached ARIBIA LLC Valuation Statement (September 14, 2024) for a
detailed breakdown of the valuation, including the supporting documents used to ensure
accuracy.
2. Fiduciary Duties and Financial Obligations
Unpaid Rent for Morada Mami: According to our records, rent for March, April, and
May 2024 was paid. However, rent remains unpaid for 10 months between September
2023 and September 2024, leaving an outstanding balance of $4,000
As a member of ARIBIA LLC, you are required to fulfill your financial and operational
responsibilities as outlined in the ARIBIA LLC Operating Agreement and Shareholder
Agreement. Unfortunately, several financial obligations have not been met, which has
placed a financial burden on the company:
Back Rent Paid by ARIBIA LLC for Cozy Castle: ARIBIA LLC covered $9,880 in back
rent on your behalf for Cozy Castle for the period from December 2023 to June 2024.
These financial obligations are fully documented, and the attached Rent Payment Records
provide a complete account of the payments made and the outstanding balances owed.
3. Authority for Decision-Making and Member Responsibilities
As outlined in the ARIBIA LLC Operating Agreement and Shareholder Agreement, the
company operates under a management structure that grants decision-making authority
to the majority member, including decisions regarding the financial stability of the
company and the responsibilities of its members. It is essential that all members fulfill
their duties and obligations to ensure the ongoing success of the company.
27 of 29

The decisions made regarding the valuation and the handling of financial obligations are
in full compliance with the company’s governance documents. If you believe there are
inaccuracies or have concerns regarding the financial records or the valuation process, I
encourage you to bring them forward so that we can address them constructively.
However, it is critical to resolve the outstanding obligations in accordance with the
company’s agreements.
4. Opportunity to Discuss and Next Steps
I remain open to discussing any concerns you may have regarding your obligations and
contributions to the company. However, it is important that we address these issues
promptly to ensure the continued financial health of ARIBIA LLC. Please review the
attached documents, and I look forward to resolving any remaining issues.
Best regards,
Nicholas Bianchi
President, ARIBIA LLC
