Memo: Billing Attribution to Luisa Arias for Legal Services
From: Nicholas Anthony Jones Bianchi
Date: March 6, 2025
Subject: Execution of Legal Services Bill – Luisa Arias
Background:
This memo serves as an official directive to attribute the legal services bill
associated with resolving tenant default issues at URBANIZACION PLAZA DE
COLORES to Luisa Arias due to her explicit refusal to abide by the terms of the
operating agreement.
As a result of this refusal, legal action was necessary to ensure compliance with
lease
agreements and prevent further financial harm to the property’s ownership. The
services provided by Medellin Legal include:

Legal Opinion – 3,250,000 COP
Letter Addressed to Tenants – 3,250,000 COP
● Obtaining a Public Deed at Notary – 650,000 COP
● Total: 7,150,000 COP (~1,713 USD)
●
●

Payment Structure:

Initial Retainer (50%): 3,575,887 COP (~856 USD)
● Final Payment (50%): 3,575,887 COP (~856 USD)
●

Directive:
Given that these expenses were incurred directly due to Luisa Arias’s noncompliance with the operating agreement, this invoice should be fully attributed
to her within DoorLoop as a chargeback for legal expenses related to her failure
to uphold contractual obligations.
If any questions arise regarding this billing attribution, please escalate them
immediately for further discussion. However, this action is non-negotiable as it
reflects a necessary cost of enforcing compliance with the agreement.
Next Steps:

. Process the full amount (7,150,000 COP) as an expense against Luisa
Arias.
. Document the charge in DoorLoop with supporting notes referencing her
contractual breach.
. Ensure future legal-related costs from similar breaches are preemptively
structured as direct charges to responsible parties.
