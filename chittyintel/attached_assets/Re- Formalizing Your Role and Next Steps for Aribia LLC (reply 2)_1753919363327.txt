Hi Lulu,
Again, we’re not here to debate what you think or what I think. The goal is to clean up loose
ends and streamline the business so we can all move forward successfully.
Best regards,

Hi
Regadles of the cell phone situation, we don’t have any desire to continue with this service and
this situation.
As a reminder, we never asked for the upgrade of them so, with the same urgency you ask for
the payment, with that same urgency we ask for the return of our original phones that we gave
directly to you.
iPhone 11 Pro Max (unlocked)
iPhone 14 ProMax (AT&T)

Hi
Also one more thing
Since I wasn’t able to get into the apartment because you locked the door, I’m asking you Nick
once again how I can get my personal belongings back.
I have my TV and my plants still there, they were never intended to stay there, you just didn’t
allow me to get them
We can coordinate the pick up of my items and the drop off of the keys in next couple of days

Thank you very much

Hi good morning
We would happily return these phones as soon as we get back our original ones we gave to
you in order to trade them for these new ones.
As a reminder, this update was never asked by us, was an idea that came from you in order
to get a better deal on internet service for Aribia’s properties and for upgrading your
personal and business phones.
That being said and you will understand that we need our original phones that are
iPhone 11 Max (unlocked)
iPhone 14 Pro Max (AT&T)
In the meantime, until we get them back, we’ll keep making the monthly payments

6 of 11

Also, I would be happy to drop off Aribia’s keys and fobs the day I pick up the phones since
I don’t live in your area, I understand that it doesn’t make any sense for me to have them
since I basically was kicked out of Surf 504 and locked out and make a new ones for the
new tenant would be expensive.
Regardless of the rent of the property in Medellín, you would understand that since I
worked for Aribia for all these past years (since it’s creation until not too long ago) without
any monetary compensation, I have been left out in a very difficult situation. You have been
the only one receiving and distributing the funds of the company and the poor management
is the reason why the company is not in the best shape.

Also my brother who came here under promises that never came true, got very affected by
this situation, so it’s very hard for us to keep giving to the company without any
compensation in return, our last intent to keep pushing forward with this project, was the 2
days in the last weeks when we were there to keep working on the remodel of the 504
apartment but our access to the property was denied by you.

That being said, I am very happy and open to collaborating with you as always, in order to
make of Aribia the best possible but, I can’t keep doing everything I get asked for to do
since I’m the most affected in this situation.

Thank you and have a good day

Hi Luisa,

I hope this message finds you well. I’ve CC-ed Sharon, as the other vested member of
ARIBIA LLC, so that we can all stay aligned on the business aspects and ensure
transparency as we proceed with these important next steps. It’s important that we keep
the conversation focused on resolving the business issues at hand

1. ARIBIA LLC’s Assets and Ownership Structure
To ensure clarity moving forward, I want to distinguish between the properties that
ARIBIA LLC owns outright and those that are managed by the business:

Owned Assets:
Medellín Property and Appliances: ARIBIA LLC fully owns the Medellín property
and the appliances within it as a business asset.
City Studio: Through its 100% ownership of “ARIBIA LLC - City Studio,”
ARIBIA LLC fully owns Surf 211.
Apt Arlene: ARIBIA LLC has partial ownership of Apt Arlene through its majority
8 of 11

stake in “ARIBIA LLC - Apt Arlene.”
Fixed Assets: ARIBIA LLC, through its ownership of ARIBIA LLC - MGMT,
holds various fixed assets that were contributed to the business.

Managed Properties:
550 W Surf #504 and 541 W Addison #3S: These properties remain personally
owned by me but are managed through an agreement with ARIBIA LLC - MGMT.

This distinction is important to ensure our decision-making and financial considerations
remain focused on the business’s needs.

2. Medellín Property as a Business Asset
The Medellín property is, first and foremost, a business asset. It was acquired by the
business to drive value and generate returns. While your mom and brother currently reside
there, the purpose of the property remains to serve the business, not as a personal or
family accommodation. The property was purchased with the expectation that it would
contribute to the overall success of ARIBIA LLC, and the rent generated from it is part of
maintaining its value in our portfolio.

Family ties do not negate the obligation to pay rent, just as they wouldn’t with any other
tenant. I personally provided 100% of the capital contribution to acquire this property, and
it continues to be an important investment for ARIBIA LLC. Therefore, the rent must be
paid on time to protect this investment.

3. Contributions and Capital Reassessment
Given the current situation, we will be reassessing all member capital contributions and
adjusting ownership percentages accordingly. This includes contributions in the form of
financial capital, operational involvement, and any outstanding obligations. Ensuring that
contributions are accurately accounted for is essential to keeping the business running
smoothly and fairly.

4. Past-Due Rent on the Medellín Property
9 of 11

Regarding the Medellín property, the most recent rent owed is $800, covering the past two
months. However, considering past instances where rent was not prioritized, we need to
address any additional past-due amounts. Moving forward, all outstanding rent payments
will be considered as part of the capital reassessment and the valuation of ownership
stakes.

5. Return of Keys and Fobs
To streamline operations and avoid unnecessary costs, I need all keys and fobs returned
for the properties, particularly for Cozy Castle. These items represent a direct cost to the
business, and we need to ensure they are properly accounted for.

6. Cell Phone Service
To resolve the cell phone situation, here are the available options:

1. Pay Off Phones: You can pay off the phones to transfer the service elsewhere.
2. Transfer to Xfinity: If you have Xfinity at your new residence, you should be able to
transfer the service to your responsibility.
3. Return Devices: Alternatively, you can return the devices to the business. If you’d
like to keep your phone numbers, we can facilitate the transfer to your personal
accounts.

7. Formalizing Your Departure
Given that you’ve shifted your focus away from operational involvement in the business,
it’s important that we formalize your departure from an active role within ARIBIA LLC.
I’ve attached a resignation letter for you to review and sign, which will allow us to update
the company’s records accordingly.

8. Cozy Castle Non-Delivery
Regarding the non-delivery of Cozy Castle, we have addressed this matter with the
tenants directly, and the situation has been resolved. Our focus now is on stabilizing the
business, finalizing any outstanding matters, and ensuring that ARIBIA LLC can continue
to move forward efficiently.

9. Deal No Longer on the Table
Regarding the previous proposal we discussed, that option is no longer on the table due to
the financial challenges the business is currently facing. Any future discussions about
buyouts or ownership transfers will need to be revisited based on updated financial
evaluations and reassessment of contributions.

Next Steps
1. Formal Resignation: Please review and sign the attached resignation letter. Once
finalized, we’ll update the company’s records to reflect this change.
2. Return of Keys and Fobs: Please arrange to return the keys and fobs for all
properties, particularly Cozy Castle, to avoid any unnecessary costs to the business.
3. Financial Considerations: If there are any outstanding financial matters or
contributions that need to be addressed, we should resolve them as part of this
process. This includes resolving the past-due rent on the Medellín property, the cell
phone situation, and any potential investments in the business.

It’s important that we finalize these decisions promptly so that ARIBIA LLC can continue
operating effectively. I look forward to your response and to finalizing these matters.

Best regards,
Nick Bianchi
President, ARIBIA LLC
