Hi
Also one more thing
Since I wasn’t able to get into the apartment because you locked the door, I’m asking you Nick once again how I can get my personal belongings
back.
I have my TV and my plants still there, they were never intended to stay there, you just didn’t allow me to get them
We can coordinate the pick up of my items and the drop oc of the keys in next couple of days
Thank you very much

Hi good morning
We would happily return these phones as soon as we get back our original ones we gave to you in order to trade them for these new ones.
As a reminder, this update was never asked by us, was an idea that came from you in order to get a better deal on internet service for Aribia’s properties
and for upgrading your personal and business phones.
That being said and you will understand that we need our original phones that are
iPhone 11 Max (unlocked)
iPhone 14 Pro Max (AT&T)
In the meantime, until we get them back, we’ll keep making the monthly payments

Also, I would be happy to drop off Aribia’s keys and fobs the day I pick up the phones since I don’t live in your area, I understand that it doesn’t make any
sense for me to have them since I basically was kicked out of Surf 504 and locked out and make a new ones for the new tenant would be expensive.
Regardless of the rent of the property in Medellín, you would understand that since I worked for Aribia for all these past years (since it’s creation
until not too long ago) without any monetary compensation, I have been left out in a very dicicult situation. You have been the only one receiving
and distributing the funds of the company and the poor management is the reason why the company is not in the best shape.

Also my brother who came here under promises that never came true, got very acected by this situation, so it’s very hard for us to keep giving to
the company without any compensation in return, our last intent to keep pushing forward with this project, was the 2 days in the last weeks when
we were there to keep working on the remodel of the 504 apartment but our access to the property was denied by you.
That being said, I am very happy and open to collaborating with you as always, in order to make of Aribia the best possible but, I can’t keep doing
everything I get asked for to do since I’m the most acected in this situation.
Thank you and have a good day

Hi Luisa,
I hope this message ﬁnds you well. I’ve CC-ed Sharon, as the other vested member of ARIBIA LLC, so that we can all stay aligned on the
business aspects and ensure transparency as we proceed with these important next steps. It’s important that we keep the conversation
focused on resolving the business issues at hand

4 of 6

1. ARIBIA LLC’s Assets and Ownership Structure

To ensure clarity moving forward, I want to distinguish between the properties that ARIBIA LLC owns outright and those that are managed by the
business:

Owned Assets:
Medellín Property and Appliances: ARIBIA LLC fully owns the Medellín property and the appliances within it as a business asset.
City Studio: Through its 100% ownership of “ARIBIA LLC - City Studio,” ARIBIA LLC fully owns Surf 211.
Apt Arlene: ARIBIA LLC has partial ownership of Apt Arlene through its majority stake in “ARIBIA LLC - Apt Arlene.”
Fixed Assets: ARIBIA LLC, through its ownership of ARIBIA LLC - MGMT, holds various ﬁxed assets that were contributed to the business.

Managed Properties:
550 W Surf #504 and 541 W Addison #3S: These properties remain personally owned by me but are managed through an agreement with
ARIBIA LLC - MGMT.
This distinction is important to ensure our decision-making and ﬁnancial considerations remain focused on the business’s needs.

2. Medellín Property as a Business Asset

The Medellín property is, ﬁrst and foremost, a business asset. It was acquired by the business to drive value and generate returns. While your
mom and brother currently reside there, the purpose of the property remains to serve the business, not as a personal or family
accommodation. The property was purchased with the expectation that it would contribute to the overall success of ARIBIA LLC, and the rent
generated from it is part of maintaining its value in our portfolio.
Family ties do not negate the obligation to pay rent, just as they wouldn’t with any other tenant. I personally provided 100% of the capital
contribution to acquire this property, and it continues to be an important investment for ARIBIA LLC. Therefore, the rent must be paid on time to
protect this investment.

3. Contributions and Capital Reassessment

Given the current situation, we will be reassessing all member capital contributions and adjusting ownership percentages accordingly. This
includes contributions in the form of ﬁnancial capital, operational involvement, and any outstanding obligations. Ensuring that contributions
are accurately accounted for is essential to keeping the business running smoothly and fairly.

4. Past-Due Rent on the Medellín Property

Regarding the Medellín property, the most recent rent owed is $800, covering the past two months. However, considering past instances where
rent was not prioritized, we need to address any additional past-due amounts. Moving forward, all outstanding rent payments will be
considered as part of the capital reassessment and the valuation of ownership stakes.

5. Return of Keys and Fobs

To streamline operations and avoid unnecessary costs, I need all keys and fobs returned for the properties, particularly for Cozy Castle. These
items represent a direct cost to the business, and we need to ensure they are properly accounted for.

6. Cell Phone Service

To resolve the cell phone situation, here are the available options:
g. Pay Oc Phones: You can pay oc the phones to transfer the service elsewhere.
h. Transfer to Xﬁnity: If you have Xﬁnity at your new residence, you should be able to transfer the service to your responsibility.
i. Return Devices: Alternatively, you can return the devices to the business. If you’d like to keep your phone numbers, we can facilitate the
transfer to your personal accounts.

7. Formalizing Your Departure

Given that you’ve shifted your focus away from operational involvement in the business, it’s important that we formalize your departure from an
active role within ARIBIA LLC. I’ve attached a resignation letter for you to review and sign, which will allow us to update the company’s records
accordingly.

8. Cozy Castle Non-Delivery

Regarding the non-delivery of Cozy Castle, we have addressed this matter with the tenants directly, and the situation has been resolved. Our
focus now is on stabilizing the business, ﬁnalizing any outstanding matters, and ensuring that ARIBIA LLC can continue to move forward
eciciently.

9. Deal No Longer on the Table

Regarding the previous proposal we discussed, that option is no longer on the table due to the ﬁnancial challenges the business is currently
facing. Any future discussions about buyouts or ownership transfers will need to be revisited based on updated ﬁnancial evaluations and

5 of 6

reassessment of contributions.

Next Steps
g. Formal Resignation: Please review and sign the attached resignation letter. Once ﬁnalized, we’ll update the company’s records to reﬂect
this change.
h. Return of Keys and Fobs: Please arrange to return the keys and fobs for all properties, particularly Cozy Castle, to avoid any unnecessary
costs to the business.
i. Financial Considerations: If there are any outstanding ﬁnancial matters or contributions that need to be addressed, we should resolve
them as part of this process. This includes resolving the past-due rent on the Medellín property, the cell phone situation, and any
potential investments in the business.
It’s important that we ﬁnalize these decisions promptly so that ARIBIA LLC can continue operating ecectively. I look forward to your response
and to ﬁnalizing these matters.
Best regards,
Nick Bianchi
President, ARIBIA LLC
