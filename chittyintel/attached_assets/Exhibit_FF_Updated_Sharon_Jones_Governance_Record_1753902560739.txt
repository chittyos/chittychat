This timeline proves that Sharon Jones’ participation in ARIBIA LLC was governed entirely by formal capital-based contracts and international compliance requirements. Her temporary removal was due to Colombian anti-money laundering (AML) identity documentation protocols — not any equity or performance issue. Her subsequent reinstatement and contribution demonstrate ARIBIA’s structured governance process and reinforce the claim that ownership within ARIBIA was earned, not implied by marriage.
