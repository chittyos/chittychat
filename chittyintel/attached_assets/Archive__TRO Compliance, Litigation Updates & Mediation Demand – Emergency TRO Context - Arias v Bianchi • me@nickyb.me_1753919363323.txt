Hi Jonathan & Madyson,
Following up on key legal actions and ensuring alignment ahead of pretrial work.
Madyson – I’ve added key points on the emergency nature of the TRO and its
contradictions for inclusion in the mediation demand.
1. TRO Compliance – Clarification & Positioning
All eviction and debt recovery actions in Colombia have been exclusively
handled by Medellín Legal Partners (MLP) since November 8, 2024.
No direct communication, eviction "threats", or unauthorized actions have been
taken by me personally since the TRO issuance.
Opposing counsel is attempting to misrepresent ARIBIA LLC as a marital asset to
extend the TRO’s scope beyond its legal intent.
Should Opposing counsel be required to specify exactly which alleged violations
support their emergency claims?
2. Litigation Next Steps – Colombia
MLP has confirmed that formal litigation is required for:
Eviction lawsuit (Restitution of Leased Property – Morada Mami
Debt recovery (Executive Process for unpaid rent balance – $6,400 USD
Since MLP does not handle litigation, we would need to engage one a litigation
attorney (not sure the $ but will be exploring)
Next Steps:
Let me know if any formal documentation is needed regarding this engagement
for pretrial filings.
3. U.S. Legal Actions – Financial Recovery & TRO Positioning (Docs Attached)
To reinforce financial harm and Luisa’s misrepresentations, I would like to proceed
with formal repayment demands:
1 of 3

SNAP Benefits Misuse ($1,644.50) – Sent by Me (Certified Email & Certified
Mail). Luisa improperly collected SNAP benefits under my name from July 15 –
Dec 31, 2024.
Action: Demand repayment within 14 days or escalate via small claims court and
formal complaints to IDHS/USDA.
Pine Grove Lease Refund ($828.50) – Sent by Me (Certified Email & Certified
Mail)
Luisa received and cashed a lease refund check on Jan 22, 2025, despite my
covering unpaid rent on her behalf.
Action: Demand repayment within 14 days or escalate via small claims court and
other legal recovery options.
IT CAN BE LLC Mediation Demand – To Be Sent by Sharon Jones / IT CAN BE
LLC (Certified Email & Certified Mail)
This demand will formally request mediation regarding Luisa’s
misrepresentations, falsifications and misuse of company funds and assets
before pursuing further legal action.
⸻
4. Emergency Nature of the TRO – Key Points for Mediation Demand
TRO’s Emergency Justification is Contradicted by Luisa’s Own Actions:
TRO Standard: A temporary restraining order is an emergency remedy requiring
immediate and irreparable harm if relief is not granted.
Contradiction: Since the TRO was issued, Luisa has:
Refused to mediate or engage in resolution efforts
Made no actual claims of new harm or threats—only using the TRO to delay
financial accountability.
Benefited financially from improper fund retention (SNAP misuse, lease refund,
unpaid rent at Cozy Castle).
Actively obstructed ARIBIA LLC’s business operations without legal standing.
No Immediate Threat Justifying TRO Enforcement:
Luisa does not reside at Morada Mami, yet she is blocking eviction proceedings
for defaulted tenants who are unrelated to the TRO.
Luisa has no ownership stake in ARIBIA LLC, yet she is attempting to dictate
business decisions under the guise of emergency relief.
If there were a true emergency, why has she refused mediation or alternative
resolutions for months?
(if) Does Mediation Refusal Strengthens the Argument for TRO Modification or
2 of 3

Dismissal?
If Luisa genuinely believed urgent action was needed, she would have engaged
in mediation.
Her outright refusal to resolve key financial matters demonstrates that the TRO
is being used as a shield for bad faith obstruction rather than legitimate
protection.
Could this refusal be explicitly highlighted to challenge the TRO’s validity and
scope?
⸻
5. Final Steps & Confirmations Needed:
Pretrial Memo: Do we need adjustments based on these emergency TRO
contradictions?
TRO Defense: Reinforce that the emergency relief standard is not met based on
Luisa’s own actions.
Final Review of Demand Letters: Would you mind taking a look at the attached?
If all looks good, I will proceed with sending the repayment requests via certified
email and certified mail this week, and IT CAN BE LLC will send the mediation
demand.
Thanks for you support and guidance! - Nick
