Ref: Engagement to perform legal services
Dear Nicholas Anthony Jones Bianchi (President and legal representative of ARIBIA LLC).
We are pleased to provide you with our services to present possible legal solutions for your
current situation with tenants who have defaulted on rental payments owed under the
lease agreement to which they are subject.
This engagement letter outlines the scope of services we will provide, which include a legal
opinion, a letter notifying debtors of their default, and obtaining a public deed at a notary.
1. Scope of Engagement:
Our services will consist of a legal opinion in which we provide solutions to your

problem, analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of each option, allowing you
to make more informed decisions based on Colombian laws.
Also a letter addressed to the individuals who have failed to make payments, not
necessarily proposing payment methods, but emphasizing the specific judicial
consequences they may face for non-payment and failure to vacate the property.
Our firm will be in capacity to perform the above services under the following areas of law:
- Foreign Exchange Law;
- Corporate Law;
- Contract Law
- Tax Law (Domestic and International)
Finally, we calculate that our services will be implemented in a period of four (4) weeks.
No later than one (1) week after we initiate the process, we will send a request for
additional information in order to render the Services.

2. Explicit Exclusions:
The services delivered to you when furnishing the Services will be limited to the areas of
law indicated in the Scope of the Services.
3. Conflicts of Interest.
Our firm represents multiple clients across various sectors. In certain instances, our clients
may have business dealings, negotiations, or disputes, including litigation, with other
clients of the Firm. By accepting this engagement, you consent that we may, in the future,
represent existing or new clients in matters involving or relating to you, including litigation
against you or other matters that may be directly or indirectly adverse to your interests,
provided that such matters are not substantially related to this representation or any other
matter on which you engage our Services.
For instance, you agree that we may represent debtors, trustees, examiners, or official
committees in bankruptcy cases in which you are a creditor or have a party interest, even
if your interests are adverse to those debtors, trustees, examiners, or official committees,
as long as our representation is not substantially related to our work for you.
After a thorough review, we confirm that there are no existing conflicts of interest that
would prevent us from representing you in this matter.
4. Engagement Limited to Identified Client.
This letter confirms that our engagement is solely with the individuals or entities
specifically identified as clients in this letter (i.e., you). Unless otherwise agreed in writing,
we do not represent any individuals, family members, or entities not named as clients
herein.
We are delighted to have been asked to provide legal services and look forward to working
with you on this engagement. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any
matters regarding our legal representation or billing, please feel free to reach me directly
at +57 312 874 3398, andres@medellinlegal.com, or mariana@medellinlegal.com.
While I would prefer a less formal method of confirming the terms of our engagement, our
experience shows that having a written confirmation is beneficial to both parties.
Additionally, in certain cases, the Firm is legally required to document these matters in
writing.
