Dear LuLu,
I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to address your recent emails and provide clarity on the business and personal matters you’ve raised.

1. Ownership and Capital Contributions
After reviewing all contributions to Aribia LLC, including both operational efforts and financial inputs, here is a summary of the current status:
Nick’s Contributions:

•

Initial Capital: $120,000 (including the purchase of City Studio).
Additional Contributions: $90,000 for the Medellín property, $30,000 for Apt Arlene, and $21,470 in upgrades and fixed assets for Lakeside Loft.
Conservative estimate of only cash contributions to the business of $302,947.47 over two years since he established the business on 7/15/2022.
Cozy Castle Rent Payments: Nick covered the rent from November 2023 to August 2024, totaling approximately $23,000.
Supplementary Support: Nick also supplemented your living expenses at Cozy Castle with $1,000 per month from April 2022 to May 2023.
Cash Compensation of $3000 to Luisa in June 2024
Cash Compensation of ~$6000 to Alejandro Arias + payments made in good faith to get cars out of shop/paid off repairs and paid travel expenses
Business Coverage: The business covered your $400 broker’s license courses, training, and test. Additionally, the business has covered your phone and payments for at
least a year, and Nick covered these expenses prior to that.
Ongoing Capital Infusions: Nick has provided significant ongoing operational, marketing, and technical support, including managing all business operations and project
management.

LuLu’s Contributions:
•
•
•

Design Input and Cleaning Services: Considering a more generous valuation based on actual contributions and operational impact, the estimated value is approximately
$15,000 over two years.
Guest Relations: Assisting with guest communications and other part-time tasks, valued at $5,000 over the same period.
Phone and Courses: The business covered LuLu’s phone and payments for the past 6 months and prior to that, Nick covered these expenses.

Sharon’s Contributions:
•
•
•

$10,000 contribution towards operational costs.
$5,000 in additional payments.
A $100,000 low-interest loan to the business, which is not considered a capital contribution but supports the company’s operations.

Given these contributions, a reevaluation of ownership stakes is currently being conducted to ensure fairness and accuracy. We will share the final figures once the evaluation is
completed.

2. Personal Belongings
•
•
•
•
•

Bed Frame: As per your direction, the bed frame was disposed of.
The couch: You made the decision to sell as you had no income to cover any of your expenses.
TV: The TV you mentioned was not a personal item. It was acquired by me for business purposes from a neighbor and is considered a business asset.
Plants: The plants were purchased by the business.
Other Items: There is a pair of Ale’s shoes left, and no other personal items remain at the residence. You moved out and confirmed there was nothing left, though later
claimed you were locked out.

Please let me know if there are any further questions or concerns.
Best regards,
Nick Bianchi
President, Aribia LLC

Hi
To better understand how this process works, could you please be more speciﬁc about why you are looking for me to resign ? For what? I
understand your personal beneﬁt from it but what is the beneﬁt for me? Where is, in this situation, my participation from the beginning until
now in Aribia? My work for 2 and a half years without any monetary compensation, from it’s creation to this day? My 10% ownership ?
I think these answers will help to make more sense of your requests and expectations
Thank you

Hi
Also one more thing
Since I wasn’t able to get into the apartment because you locked the door, I’m asking you Nick once again how I can get my personal
belongings back.
I have my TV and my plants still there, they were never intended to stay there, you just didn’t allow me to get them
We can coordinate the pick up of my items and the drop om of the keys in next couple of days
Thank you very much

Hi good morning
We would happily return these phones as soon as we get back our original ones we gave to you in order to trade them for these new ones.
As a reminder, this update was never asked by us, was an idea that came from you in order to get a better deal on internet service for Aribia’s
properties and for upgrading your personal and business phones.
That being said and you will understand that we need our original phones that are
iPhone 11 Max (unlocked)
iPhone 14 Pro Max (AT&T)
In the meantime, until we get them back, we’ll keep making the monthly payments

7 of 10

Also, I would be happy to drop off Aribia’s keys and fobs the day I pick up the phones since I don’t live in your area, I understand that it doesn’t
make any sense for me to have them since I basically was kicked out of Surf 504 and locked out and make a new ones for the new tenant would
be expensive.
Regardless of the rent of the property in Medellín, you would understand that since I worked for Aribia for all these past years (since it’s
creation until not too long ago) without any monetary compensation, I have been left out in a very dimicult situation. You have been the
only one receiving and distributing the funds of the company and the poor management is the reason why the company is not in the best
shape.

Also my brother who came here under promises that never came true, got very amected by this situation, so it’s very hard for us to keep
giving to the company without any compensation in return, our last intent to keep pushing forward with this project, was the 2 days in
the last weeks when we were there to keep working on the remodel of the 504 apartment but our access to the property was denied by
you.
That being said, I am very happy and open to collaborating with you as always, in order to make of Aribia the best possible but, I can’t
keep doing everything I get asked for to do since I’m the most amected in this situation.
Thank you and have a good day

Hi Luisa,
I hope this message ﬁnds you well. I’ve CC-ed Sharon, as the other vested member of ARIBIA LLC, so that we can all stay aligned on
the business aspects and ensure transparency as we proceed with these important next steps. It’s important that we keep the
conversation focused on resolving the business issues at hand

1. ARIBIA LLC’s Assets and Ownership Structure

To ensure clarity moving forward, I want to distinguish between the properties that ARIBIA LLC owns outright and those that are
managed by the business:

Owned Assets:
Medellín Property and Appliances: ARIBIA LLC fully owns the Medellín property and the appliances within it as a business asset.
City Studio: Through its 100% ownership of “ARIBIA LLC - City Studio,” ARIBIA LLC fully owns Surf 211.
Apt Arlene: ARIBIA LLC has partial ownership of Apt Arlene through its majority stake in “ARIBIA LLC - Apt Arlene.”
Fixed Assets: ARIBIA LLC, through its ownership of ARIBIA LLC - MGMT, holds various ﬁxed assets that were contributed to the
business.

Managed Properties:
550 W Surf #504 and 541 W Addison #3S: These properties remain personally owned by me but are managed through an
agreement with ARIBIA LLC - MGMT.
This distinction is important to ensure our decision-making and ﬁnancial considerations remain focused on the business’s needs.

2. Medellín Property as a Business Asset

The Medellín property is, ﬁrst and foremost, a business asset. It was acquired by the business to drive value and generate returns.
While your mom and brother currently reside there, the purpose of the property remains to serve the business, not as a personal or
family accommodation. The property was purchased with the expectation that it would contribute to the overall success of ARIBIA
LLC, and the rent generated from it is part of maintaining its value in our portfolio.
Family ties do not negate the obligation to pay rent, just as they wouldn’t with any other tenant. I personally provided 100% of the
capital contribution to acquire this property, and it continues to be an important investment for ARIBIA LLC. Therefore, the rent must
be paid on time to protect this investment.

3. Contributions and Capital Reassessment

Given the current situation, we will be reassessing all member capital contributions and adjusting ownership percentages
accordingly. This includes contributions in the form of ﬁnancial capital, operational involvement, and any outstanding obligations.
Ensuring that contributions are accurately accounted for is essential to keeping the business running smoothly and fairly.

4. Past-Due Rent on the Medellín Property

Regarding the Medellín property, the most recent rent owed is $800, covering the past two months. However, considering past
instances where rent was not prioritized, we need to address any additional past-due amounts. Moving forward, all outstanding rent
payments will be considered as part of the capital reassessment and the valuation of ownership stakes.

5. Return of Keys and Fobs

To streamline operations and avoid unnecessary costs, I need all keys and fobs returned for the properties, particularly for Cozy
Castle. These items represent a direct cost to the business, and we need to ensure they are properly accounted for.

6. Cell Phone Service

To resolve the cell phone situation, here are the available options:
p. Pay Om Phones: You can pay om the phones to transfer the service elsewhere.
q. Transfer to Xﬁnity: If you have Xﬁnity at your new residence, you should be able to transfer the service to your responsibility.
r. Return Devices: Alternatively, you can return the devices to the business. If you’d like to keep your phone numbers, we can
facilitate the transfer to your personal accounts.

7. Formalizing Your Departure

Given that you’ve shifted your focus away from operational involvement in the business, it’s important that we formalize your
departure from an active role within ARIBIA LLC. I’ve attached a resignation letter for you to review and sign, which will allow us to
update the company’s records accordingly.

8. Cozy Castle Non-Delivery
9 of 10

Regarding the non-delivery of Cozy Castle, we have addressed this matter with the tenants directly, and the situation has been
resolved. Our focus now is on stabilizing the business, ﬁnalizing any outstanding matters, and ensuring that ARIBIA LLC can continue
to move forward emiciently.

9. Deal No Longer on the Table

Regarding the previous proposal we discussed, that option is no longer on the table due to the ﬁnancial challenges the business is
currently facing. Any future discussions about buyouts or ownership transfers will need to be revisited based on updated ﬁnancial
evaluations and reassessment of contributions.

Next Steps
p. Formal Resignation: Please review and sign the attached resignation letter. Once ﬁnalized, we’ll update the company’s records
to reﬂect this change.
q. Return of Keys and Fobs: Please arrange to return the keys and fobs for all properties, particularly Cozy Castle, to avoid any
unnecessary costs to the business.
r. Financial Considerations: If there are any outstanding ﬁnancial matters or contributions that need to be addressed, we should
resolve them as part of this process. This includes resolving the past-due rent on the Medellín property, the cell phone situation,
and any potential investments in the business.
It’s important that we ﬁnalize these decisions promptly so that ARIBIA LLC can continue operating emectively. I look forward to your
response and to ﬁnalizing these matters.
Best regards,
Nick Bianchi
President, ARIBIA LLC
